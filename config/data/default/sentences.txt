A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.
A churchyard.
A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible; and to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the sound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful.

A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoin remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related, i the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other organi beings, with which it comes into competition for food or residence, or fro which it has to escape, or on which it preys.
A counteraction, gentle and continual, is the best safeguard of manners and conduct.
A dark, gloomy blue sky is windy; but a light, bright blue sky indicates fine weather.
A day or two might shew the difference.
A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords' departure; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more effort for the young man before he left Mansfield, that all his professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to sustain them as possible.
A definite answer to the latter question ought not to be expected seeing that no one can solve the simpler problem, why, of two races o savages, one has risen higher in the scale of civilisation than the other and this apparently implies increased brain power.
A delicate spire of an ancient building rose up from out of the trees in the middle distance, with a few grey houses clustered about it; while nearer to us, in fact not half a furlong from the water, was a quite modern stone house - a wide quadrangle of one story, the buildings that made it being quite low.

A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen returned to the drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all.
A few moments of feverish enjoyment were followed by hours of acute suffering.
A few naturalists, endowed with muc flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt the immutabilit of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look with confidence t the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view bot sides of the question with impartiality.
A few of the armed men struggled to the front, or climbled up to the base of the monument which then stood there, that they might face the wall of hidden fire before them; and to most men (there were many women amongst them) it seemed as if the end of the world had come, and to-day seemed strangely different from yesterday.
A few of the more marked signs of weather - useful alike to seaman farmer, and gardener, are the following.

A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat, and she worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford.
A good instance is afforded by the close resemblance of th jaws of the dog and Tasmanian wolf or Thylacinus - animals which are widel sundered in the natural system.

A house in town - that, she thought, must be impossible.
A huge crowd assembled in Trafalgar Square and the neighbourhood (then a place of crowded streets), and was too big for the bludgeon-armed police to cope with; there was a good deal of dry-blow fighting; three or four of the people were killed, and half a score of policemen were crushed to death in the throng, and the rest got away as they could.
A key was mislaid, Betsey accused of having got at his new hat, and some slight, but essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat, which he had been promised to have done for him, entirely neglected.
A kite hung over our heads as we passed Medmenham yesterday; magpies were quite common in the hedgerows; I saw several sparrow-hawks, and I think a merlin; and now just as we were passing the pretty bridge which had taken the place of Basildon railway-bridge, a couple of ravens croaked above our boat, as they sailed off to the higher ground of the downs.
A large amount of change, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a number of cases w cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks of th plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitche gardens.
A large and still increasing family, an husband disabled for active service, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a very small income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence, such a superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything else, as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation.

A little steering, just a touch of the rudder now and then, and with a willing listener there is no limit to the domain of equivocal speech.
A look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed a consciousness of manner on Miss Crawford's side as she made some laughing answer, was sorrowfull food for Fanny's observation; and finding herself quite unable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she was now following the others, she had nearly resolved on going home immediately, and only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of the great clock at Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that she had really been much longer absent than usual, and brought the previous self-inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just then, and how, to a very speedy issue.

A mother has no longer any mere sordid anxieties for the future of her children.
A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends t reappear in the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier.
A much more serious objection has been urged by Bronn, and recently b Broca, namely, that many characters appear to be of no service whatever t their possessors, and therefore cannot have been influenced through natura selection.
A multitude of cases could b given of very closely allied species which will not unite, or only wit extreme difficulty; and on the other hand of very distinct species whic unite with the utmost facility.
A naturalist struck with a parallelism of this nature, by arbitrarily raising or sinkin the value of the groups in several classes (and all our experience show that their valuation is as yet arbitrary), could easily extend th parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternar and ternary classifications have probably arisen.
A new variety raised b man will be a far more important and interesting subject for study than on more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species.
A niece of ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of yours, would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages.
A number of species, however, keeping in a bod might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within the same period several of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming int competition with foreign associates, might become modified; so that we mus not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time.
A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.
A pang shot through me, as of some disaster long expected and suddenly realised.
A plan which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which only one of an averag comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants o the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground.

A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all.
A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, tha barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in  close and important manner to the differences between the productions o various regions.
A sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing.
A set of animals, with thei organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete with a set mor perfectly diversified in structure.
A short silence followed.
A shower had just skimmed by, but now the sun shone brightly, and the air smelt of the pines and the grass.
A similar line of argumen holds good with fruits; that a ripe strawberry or cherry is as pleasing t the eye as to the palate - that the gaily-coloured fruit of the spindle-woo tree and the scarlet berries of the holly are beautiful objects - will b admitted by everyone.
A similar meeting had been treated in the same way a few days before at a place called Manchester, which has now disappeared.

A small turnscrew being applied gently to the screw head at the back.
A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth.
A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook�s next door to each other, with a laundress�s next door to that! That was the pudding!

A soon as this occurred, the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build u flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between the basins, so tha each hexagonal prism was built upon the scalloped edge of a smooth basin instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case o ordinary cells.
A sort of irregular war was carried on with varied success all over the country; and at last the Government, which at first pretended to ignore the struggle, or treat it as mere rioting, definitely declared for 'the Friends of Order,' and joined to their bands whatsoever of the regular army they could get together, and made a desperate effort to overwhelm 'the rebels,' as they were now once more called, and as indeed they called themselves.
A squall cloud that can be seen through or under is not likely to bring or be accompanied by, so much wind as a dark continued cloud extending beyond the horizon.
A stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of the carriage, was all the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he made no objection to her kissing him, though still entirely engaged in detailing farther particulars of the Thrush's going out of harbour, in which he had a strong right of interest, being to commence his career of seamanship in her at this very time.
A stil greater number must be called monstrosities, such as six-fingered men porcupine men, Ancon sheep, Niata cattle, etc.; and as they are widel different in character from natural species, they throw very little ligh on our subject.
A strange sensation came over me; I shut my eyes to keep out the sight of the sun glittering on this fair abode of gardens, and for a moment there passed before them a phantasmagoria of another day.

A strictly terrestrial animal, by occasionall hunting for food in shallow water, then in streams or lakes, might at las be converted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic as to brave the ope ocean.
A structur which has been developed through long-continued selection, when it cease to be of service to a species, generally becomes variable, as we see wit rudimentary organs; for it will no longer be regulated by this same powe of selection.
A structure used onl once in an animal's life, if of high importance to it, might be modified t any extent by natural selection; for instance, the great jaws possessed b certain insects, used exclusively for opening the cocoon - or the hard ti to the beak of unhatched birds, used for breaking the eggs.
A structure whatever it may be, which is common to many allied forms, is ranked by u as of high systematic importance, and consequently is often assumed to b of high vital importance to the species.
A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which al organic beings tend to increase.
A successful scheme of this sort generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after.
A tendency to sudden reversions to the perfec character of either parent would, also, be much more likely to occur wit mongrels, which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced an semi-monstrous in character, than with hybrids, which are descended fro species slowly and naturally produced.
A terrible tyranny our Communism, is it not? Folk used often to be warned against this very unhappiness in times past, when for every well-fed, contented person you saw a thousand miserable starvelings.

A this period the equatorial climate at the level of the sea was probabl about the same with that now experienced at the height of from five to si thousand feet under the same latitude, or perhaps even rather cooler.
A thoroughly good sermon, thoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification.
A trace of the law o embryonic resemblance occasionally lasts till a rather late age:  thu birds of the same genus, and of allied genera, often resemble each other i their immature plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in the young o the thrush group.
A trailing pal in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid o exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest service to the plant; bu as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, an which, as there is reason to believe from the distribution of the thorn bearing species in Africa and South America, serve as a defence agains browsing quadrupeds, so the spikes on the palm may at first have bee developed for this object, and subsequently have been improved and take advantage of by the plant, as it underwent further modification and becam a climber.
A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us.
A two men have sometimes independently hit on the same invention, so in th several foregoing cases it appears that natural selection, working for th good of each being, and taking advantage of all favourable variations, ha produced similar organs, as far as function is concerned, in distinc organic beings, which owe none of their structure in common to inheritanc from a common progenitor.
A vacuum.
A very ancient for may occasionally have lasted much longer than a form elsewhere subsequentl produced, especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabitin separated districts.
A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund; and with the exception of Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to her there might be some advantage in his presence, since every addition to the party must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent and unattended to.
A very few days were enough to effect this; and at the end of those few days, circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his views of pleasing her, inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose her to be pleased with everybody.
A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram's sheets of paper could do.
A very few words between them were sufficient.
A very handsome woman, splendidly clad in figured silk, was slowly passing by, looking into the windows as she went.
A very little more is all permitted to me.
A very odd game.

A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompanied these words.
A watch is always too fast or too slow.
A weariness, arising probably, in great measure, from the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarly to be respected, and they went down their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son.
A week had passed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner, when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund, the youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.
A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny had heard nothing of him.
A well-developed tai having been formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to b worked in for all sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ o prehension, or as an aid in turning, as in the case of the dog, though th aid in this latter respect must be slight, for the hare, with hardly an tail, can double still more quickly.
A well-disposed young woman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more attached to her own family; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield must naturally hold out the greatest temptation, and would, in all probability, be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent enjoyments.
A well-marked variety ma therefore be called an incipient species; but whether this belief i justifiable must be judged by the weight of the various facts an considerations to be given throughout this work.
A white ass but NOT an albino, has been described without either spinal or shoulde stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very obscure, or actually quit lost, in dark-coloured asses.
A wide distanc between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank the as distinct species; but what distance, it has been well asked, wil suffice if that between America and Europe is ample, will that betwee Europe and the Azores, or Madeira, or the Canaries, or between the severa islets of these small archipelagos, be sufficient Mr. B.D. Walsh, a distinguished entomologist of the United States, ha described what he calls Phytophagic varieties and Phytophagic species.
A woman married only six months ago; a man professing himself devoted, even engaged to another; that other her near relation; the whole family, both families connected as they were by tie upon tie; all friends, all intimate together! It was too horrible a confusion of guilt, too gross a complication of evil, for human nature, not in a state of utter barbarism, to be capable of! yet her judgment told her it was so.
A word or two from Robert the weaver, and they bustled about on our behoof, and presently came and took us by the hands and led us to a table in the pleasantest corner of the hall, where our breakfast was spread for us; and, as we sat down, one of them hurried out by the chambers aforesaid, and came back again in a little while with a great bunch of roses, very different in size and quality to what Hammersmith had been wont to grow, but very like the produce of an old country garden.
A worthy place The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to one.
A young party is always provided with a shady lane.

About halfway down, a huge building of the kind I was now prepared to expect told me that this also was a centre of some kind, and had its special public buildings.
About their centre it sometimes happens that the barometer falls as much as two or three inches, showing a diminution of atmospheric pressure by nearly a tenth part; when it should be expected, from physical considerations alone, that very dense clouds would be formed.
About these Docks are a good few houses, which, however, are not inhabited by many people permanently; I mean, those who use them come and go a good deal, the place being too low and marshy for pleasant dwelling.
Accepted or refused, his heart is wedded to her for ever.
According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, the slave in Switzerland habitually work with their masters in making the nest, an they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening; and, a Huber expressly states, their principal office is to search for aphides.
According to Isid.
According to Mr. Croll cold periods regularly recur every ten or fifteen thousand years; and thes at long intervals are extremely severe, owing to certain contingencies, o which the most important, as Sir C. Lyell has shown, is the relativ position of the land and water.
According to our experience, abrupt and strongly marke variations occur in our domesticated productions, singly and at rather lon intervals of time.
According to our theory these several relations throughout time and space are intelligible; fo whether we look to the allied forms of life which have changed durin successive ages, or to those which have changed after having migrated int distant quarters, in both cases they are connected by the same bond o ordinary generation; in both cases the laws of variation have been th same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same means of natura selection.
According to the ordinary view o each species having been independently created, we should have to attribut this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants, not to th vera causa of community of descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in  like manner, but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation.
According to the view here maintained, such language may be used literally; and the wonderfu fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous characters which they probably would have retained through inheritance, if they ha really been metamorphosed from true though extremely simple legs, is i part explained.
According to these views, it is obvious that the several species of th same genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, mus originally have proceeded from the same source, as they are descended fro the same progenitor.
According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals wit true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknow prototype which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim-bladder.
According to this view we ought occasionally to find in th same nest neuter-insects, presenting gradations of structure; and this w do find, even not rarely, considering how few neuter-insects out of Europ have been carefully examined.
According to this view, the chanc of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages o transition between any two forms, is small, for the successive changes ar supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot.
Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and this geomete has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up from hi information, and tells me that it is strictly correct: If a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in tw parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius  sqrt(2) or radius x 1.41421 (or at some lesser distance), from the centre of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer; and at the same distanc from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and parallel layer then, if planes of intersection between the several spheres in both layer be formed, there will result a double layer of hexagonal prisms unite together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs; and the rhombs and th sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle identically the sam with the best measurements which have been made of the cells of th hive-bee.
Active and fearless, and though rather small, strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added in Edmund's attendance and instructions, and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress, to make her unwilling to dismount.
Actual daylight failed us as we passed through the lovely reaches of Wargrave and Shiplake; but the moon rose behind us presently.
Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London: write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry's eyes, when he comes back, and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake.
Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining his niece, to bring his mistress under his own roof; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for her sister's proposal of coming to her, a measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other; for Mrs. Grant, having by this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the country without a family of children - having more than filled her favourite sitting-room with pretty furniture, and made a choice collection of plants and poultry - was very much in want of some variety at home.
Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else, were united in affection for these children, or, at least, were no farther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite, to whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two.
Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to �Is it a bear?� ought to have been �Yes;� inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.
Admitting then that gneiss mica-schist, granite, diorite, etc., were once necessarily covered up, ho can we account for the naked and extensive areas of such rocks in man parts of the world, except on the belief that they have subsequently bee completely denuded of all overlying strata?  That such extensive areas d exist cannot be doubted:  the granitic region of Parime is described b Humboldt as being at least nineteen times as large as Switzerland.
Advantageous as would be the alliance, and long standing and public as was the engagement, her happiness must not be sacrificed to it.
Afraid of everybody, ashamed of herself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how to look up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying.
After a few minutes they stopped entirely.
After a little while, I dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way, allowing for the difference of the time of year.
After a moment's pause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress a smile, went on.
After a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone: he should himself be of it; and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted convinced him that the suspicions whence, he must confess to himself, this very ball had in great measure sprung, were well founded.
After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again.
After a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was discussed with unabated eagerness, every one's inclination increasing by the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy, and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all, the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable.
After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.
After a thousand generations, specie (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked varieties, namel a1 and m1.
After a time, Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects, and revive some interest in the usual occupations; but whenever Lady Bertram was fixed on the event, she could see it only in one light, as comprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace never to be wiped off.
After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.
After all, people exaggerated the difficulty of life.
After all, the Mediaeval folk acted after their conscience, as your remark about their God (which is true) shows, and they were ready to bear what they inflicted on others; whereas the nineteenth century ones were hypocrites, and pretended to be humane, and yet went on tormenting those whom they dared to treat so by shutting them up in prison, for no reason at all, except that they were what they themselves, the prison-masters, had forced them to be.
After all, there is a good deal of population in places between here and Hammersmith; nor have you seen the most populous part of the town yet.
After an organ has ceased bein used, and has become in consequence much reduced, how can it be stil further reduced in size until the merest vestige is left; and how can it b finally quite obliterated?  It is scarcely possible that disuse can go o producing any further effect after the organ has once been rendere functionless.
After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now, when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect; but I can think of no other alternative.
After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he known all, might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved, both mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford's good company and good fortune, he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.
After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young people justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction of their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of Mr. Rushworth's marrying Miss Bertram.
After dinner, when he and his father were alone, he had Fanny's history; and then all the great events of the last fortnight, and the present situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him.
After fine clear weather the first signs (in the sky) of change are usually small, curled, streaked, or spotty clouds, followed by an overcasting of vapour, that grows into cloudiness.
After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate o the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into  sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable:  from tha period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object.
After fourtee thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters n14 to z14 are supposed to have been produced.
After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with.
After mature reflection, i seems to me that this could not have been effected through natura selection.
After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the breakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William's plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford's.
After settling her at Thornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort, the object of almost every day was to see her there, or to get her away from it.
After several turns, he sat down again.
After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again.
After sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained; but as there was still no appearance of tea, nor, from Betsey's reports from the kitchen, much hope of any under a considerable period, William determined to go and change his dress, and make the necessary preparations for his removal on board directly, that he might have his tea in comfort afterwards.
After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the iron gate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that their views and their plans might be more comprehensive.
After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which her interest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency of an early walk.
After tea, they had some music.
After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produce three forms, a10, f10, and m10, which, from having diverged in characte during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, bu perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent.
After that massacre, however, it was at all times doubtful if the regular soldiers would fire upon an unarmed or half-armed crowd.
After that they two not unfrequently fell in each other's way, and Dick would often treat the old boy to breakfast on a moderate scale and in a restaurant of his own selection.
After the business of arriving was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were thrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the appointed dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with abundance and elegance.
After the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over, she had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again; and when the acquaintance was renewed in town, and Mr. Rushworth's house became Crawford's object, she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it, and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends, in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted.
After the foregoing discussion, which has been much compressed, we ma assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed s much the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are thu enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings.
After the laps of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to b injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will becom extinct, as myriads have become extinct.
After this interval,  felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete.
After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent, each thoughtful: Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in the world, Mary on something of less philosophic tendency.
After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a commo expression, from one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it i generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this remnan of foreign blood.
After very warm and calm weather, rain or a storm is likely to occur or at any time when the atmosphere has been heated much above the usual temperature of the season.
After wandering about and sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings, he had so well talked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again.
After what had passed to wound and alienate the two families, the continuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such close neighbourhood would have been most distressing; but the absence of the latter, for some months purposely lengthened, ended very fortunately in the necessity, or at least the practicability, of a permanent removal.
After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.
After writing these, it was suggested that some remarks might be added for the benefit of many persons, especially young officers at sea, an the suggestion was complied with; yet not so as to diminish the portability of this compilation, or increase its price.
Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules etc., and some of these floated for a long time.
Afterwards they undergo a complete change; their eye disappear; their legs and antennae become rudimentary, and they feed o honey; so that they now more closely resemble the ordinary larvae o insects; ultimately they undergo a further transformation, and finall emerge as the perfect beetle.
Afterwards, I allowed an ant t visit them, and it immediately seemed, by its eager way of running about t be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered; it then began to pla with its antennae on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another and each, as soon as it felt the antennae, immediately lifted up it abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerl devoured by the ant.
Afterwards, when familiarised with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more largely to William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were emotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words.
Again I say, many blunders were made, but we have had time to set them right.
Again in the fossorial hymenoptera, the neuration of the wings i a character of the highest importance, because common to large groups; bu in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species, an likewise in the two sexes of the same species.
Again it seemed to look upon him.
Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea - on, on - until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship.
Again the child dreamed of the open star, and of the company of angels, and the train of people, and the rows of angels with their beaming eyes all turned upon those people's faces.
Again, 100 heads of red clover (T. pratense) produce 2,700 seeds, but the same number of protected heads produced not a singl seed.
Again, I can show that th carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape bein immediately devoured; and many kinds of seeds in the crops of floatin birds long retain their vitality:  peas and vetches, for instance, ar killed by even a few days' immersion in sea-water; but some taken out o the crop of a pigeon, which had floated on artificial sea-water for thirt days, to my surprise nearly all germinated.
Again, a organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose, and be used for  distinct one:  in certain fishes the swim-bladder seems to be rudimentar for its proper function of giving buoyancy, but has become converted into  nascent breathing organ or lung.
Again, all recent experience show that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed freely unde domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughl domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quit prolific under confinement.
Again, an organ, useful under certain conditions, might becom injurious under others, as with the wings of beetles living on small an exposed islands; and in this case natural selection will have aided i reducing the organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.
Again, as in making reciprocal crosses between the same two species, ther is occasionally a great difference in the result, so the same thing occur with trimorphic plants; for instance, the mid-styled form of Lythru salicaria was illegitimately fertilised with the greatest ease by polle from the longer stamens of the short-styled form, and yielded many seeds but the latter form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by th longer stamens of the mid-styled form.
Again, as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably to my theory the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never, as far a we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others.
Again, as more and more of pleasure is imported into work, I think we shall take up kinds of work which produce desirable wares, but which we gave up because we could not carry them on pleasantly.
Again, both with plants and animals, there is th clearest evidence that a cross between individuals of the same species which differ to a certain extent, gives vigour and fertility to th offspring; and that close interbreeding continued during severa generations between the nearest relations, if these be kept under the sam conditions of life, almost always leads to decreased size, weakness, o sterility.
Again, from the same cause it would be advantageous to the Melipona, if she were to make her cell closer together, and more regular in every way than at present; for then as we have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and b replaced by plane surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfec as that of the hive-bee.
Again, if art be inexhaustible, so is science also; and though it is no longer the only innocent occupation which is thought worth an intelligent man spending his time upon, as it once was, yet there are, and I suppose will be, many people who are excited by its conquest of difficulties, and care for it more than for anything else.
Again, innumerabl instances are known to every naturalist, of species keeping true, or no varying at all, although living under the most opposite climates.
Again, islands often posses trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceou species; now trees, as Alph.
Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have calle incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinc species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more tha do the varieties of the same species?  How do those groups of species which constitute what are called distinct genera and which differ from eac other more than do the species of the same genus, arise?  All thes results, as we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow from th struggle for life.
Again, many violent acts came from the artificial perversion of the sexual passions, which caused overweening jealousy and the like miseries.
Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of hig physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in thi condition are often of much value in classification.
Again, not a fe animals, after arriving at maturity, go on changing in character durin nearly their whole lives.
Again, plants low i the scale of organisation are generally much more widely diffused tha plants higher in the scale; and here again there is no close relation t the size of the genera.
Again, the male element may reach th female element, but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed, a seems to have been the case with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci.
Again, two distinct organs, or the same organ under two very differen forms, may simultaneously perform in the same individual the same function and this is an extremely important means of transition:  to give on instance - there are fish with gills or branchiae that breathe the ai dissolved in the water, at the same time that they breathe free air i their swim-bladders, this latter organ being divided by highly vascula partitions and having a ductus pneumaticus for the supply of air.
Again, w may suppose that at an early period of history, the men of one nation o district required swifter horses, while those of another required stronge and bulkier horses.
Again, with respect to the fertility in successiv generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, I hardly know of a instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at th same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill effects of clos interbreeding.
Again, with respect to the singular fac that many terrestrial and fresh-water animals do not undergo an metamorphosis, while marine members of the same groups pass through variou transformations, Fritz Muller has suggested that the process of slowl modifying and adapting an animal to live on the land or in fresh water instead of in the sea, would be greatly simplified by its not passin through any larval stage; for it is not probable that places well adapte for both the larval and mature stages, under such new and greatly change habits of life, would commonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by othe organisms.
Agassiz and several other highly competent judges insist that ancien animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animal belonging to the same classes; and that the geological succession o extinct forms is nearly parallel with the embryological development o existing forms.
Agassiz believes this to be a universal law of nature; and we ma hope hereafter to see the law proved true.
Agriculturists, it is true, use weather-glasses.
Ah! England was an important place in those days.
Ah! How it skreeks! There ain't such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no such old bones here, as mine.
Ah! You may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place.
Air presses on everything within about forty miles of the world's surface, like a much lighter ocean, at the bottom of which we live - not feeling its weight, becaus our bodies are full of air, but feeling its currents, the winds.
Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame �Why, where�s our Martha?� cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.
Alas! it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now the chief bane of Fanny's comfort.
Alas! poor Richard, what should this portend The servant, as in duty bound, dismounted and took the phaeton into his keeping; yet Dick thought he touched his hat to him with something of a grin.
All Huntingdon exclaimed on the greatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it.
All I can say is, that I hope he will not leave us: for don't you see, he is another kind of man to what we are used to, and somehow he makes us think of all kind of things; and already I feel as if I could understand Dickens the better for having talked with him.
All I can see is that you are angry, and I fear with me: so if you like we will change the subject.
All Mr. Mivart's objections will be, or have been, considered in th present volume.
All are supplanted sooner or later.
All arguments were in vain; the old rascal stuck to his point; nor did Richard conceal from himself how seriously this might injure his prospects, and he fought hard.
All as they should be.
All bein mainly due to the species of the same group being the descendants of  common progenitor, from whom they have inherited much in common, to part which have recently and largely varied being more likely still to go o varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not varied, t natural selection having more or less completely, according to the lapse o time, overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variability, t sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selection, and t variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexua selection, and thus having been adapted for secondary sexual, and fo ordinary purposes.
All comprehension is creation; the woman I love is somewhat of my handiwork; and the great lover, like the great painter, is he that can so embellish his subject as to make her more than human, whilst yet by a cunning art he has so based his apotheosis on the nature of the case that the woman can go on being a true woman, and give her character free play, and show littleness, or cherish spite, or be greedy of common pleasures, and he continue to worship without a thought of incongruity.
All fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is at once explained o the principle of descent.
All fresh water basins, taken together make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land.
All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerou slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations have affecte wide spaces.
All hands were working deliberately but well and steadily, though they were as noisy with merry talk as a grove of autumn starlings.
All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world.
All her attention was for her work.
All ideas of peace on a basis of compromise had disappeared on either side.
All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be done.
All of a sudden a thought takes me in the street; I become its prey: it's like a pretty woman; no use to struggle; I must - dash it off.
All other moods save this had been exhausted: the unceasing criticism, the boundless curiosity in the ways and thoughts of man, which was the mood of the ancient Greek, to whom these things were not so much a means, as an end, was gone past recovery; nor had there been really any shadow of it in the so-called science of the nineteenth century, which, as you must know, was in the main an appendage to the commercial system; nay, not seldom an appendage to the police of that system.
All over the world there is a similar difference proportionate to the range of the mercury for which allowance should always be made in considering the height of the barometer.
All possible gradations, as he adds, may likewise be foun between the pedicellariae of the star-fishes and the hooks of th Ophiurians, another group of the Echinodermata; and again between th pedicellariae of sea-urchins and the anchors of the Holothuriae, als belonging to the same great class.
All suc differences in number, and the absence of certain whole groups of animal and plants, are generally accounted for by supposed differences in th physical conditions of the islands; but this explanation is not a littl doubtful.
All such changes of structure, whethe extremely slight or strongly marked, which appear among many individual living together, may be considered as the in definite effects of th conditions of life on each individual organism, in nearly the same manne as the chill effects different men in an in definite manner, according t their state of body or constitution, causing coughs or colds, rheumatism or inflammation of various organs.
All th individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus, o even higher group, are descended from common parents; and therefore, i however distant and isolated parts of the world they may now be found, the must in the course of successive generations have travelled from some on point to all the others.
All that English abilities can do has been tried already.
All that I have attempted to show is, that in two cases in some respects allied, sterility is the common result - in the one cas from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other case fro the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations bein compounded into one.
All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer, and that he had agreed to do so.
All that cause of violent crime is gone.
All that followed was the result of her imprudence; and he went off with her at last, because he could not help it, regretting Fanny even at the moment, but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over, and a very few months had taught him, by the force of contrast, to place a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper, the purity of her mind, and the excellence of her principles.
All that is past; we are no longer hurried, and the information lies ready to each one's hand when his own inclinations impel him to seek it.
All that we can do is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being i striving to increase in a geometrical ratio; that each, at some period o its life, during some season of the year, during each generation, or a intervals, has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction.
All that we have a right t expect is, that those groups which have, within known geological periods undergone much modification, should in the older formations make som slight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ les from each other in some of their characters than do the existing members o the same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our bes palaeontologists is frequently the case.
All that we want to show is, that where man species of a genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming and this certainly holds good.
All the agreeable of her speculation was over for that hour.
All the best plays were run over in vain.
All the comfort of their comfortable journey would be destroyed at once.
All the descendants of the genus F along its whole line of descent, are supposed to have been but littl modified, and they form a single genus.
All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification may b explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natura system is founded on descent with modification - that the characters whic naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or mor species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, all tru classification being genealogical - that community of descent is the hidde bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not som unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, an the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike.
All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as befor remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects o extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into severa sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have perished a different periods, and some to have endured to the present day.
All the members of the great order of Hymenopterous insects ar terrestrial, excepting the genus Proctotrupes, which Sir John Lubbock ha discovered to be aquatic in its habits; it often enters the water and dive about by the use not of its legs but of its wings, and remains as long a four hours beneath the surface; yet it exhibits no modification i structure in accordance with its abnormal habits.
All the members of whol classes are connected together by a chain of affinities, and all can b classed on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups.
All the modified descendants from A will have inherited somethin in common from their common parent, as will all the descendants from I; s will it be with each subordinate branch of descendants at each successiv stage.
All the small country arts of life which once added to the little pleasures of country people were lost.
All the stripes soo disappeared completely.
All these angels, who were waiting, turned their beaming eyes upon the people who were carried up into the star; and some came out from the long rows in which they stood, and fell upon the people's necks, and kissed them tenderly, and went away with them down avenues of light, and were so happy in their company, that lying in his bed he wept for joy.
All these causes tend towards the sam end; but the most powerful appears to be the indirect influence of th eccentricity of the orbit upon oceanic currents.
All these modifications follow fro the relative position and inter-action of the parts; and it can hardly b doubted that if all the flowers and leaves on the same plant had bee subjected to the same external and internal condition, as are the flower and leaves in certain positions, all would have been modified in the sam manner.
All this agrees well with what we see under nature.
All this became gradually evident, and gradually placed Susan before her sister as an object of mingled compassion and respect.
All this clearly shows as Heer has remarked, that they had at this early age progresse considerably in civilisation; and this again implies a long continue previous period of less advanced civilisation, during which th domesticated animals, kept by different tribes in different districts might have varied and given rise to distinct races.
All this may be stamped on it; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road; especially as there is no real squire's house to dispute the point - a circumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation.
All this passed overnight, for the journey was to begin very early in the morning; and when the small, diminished party met at breakfast, William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage.
All this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to have made the old man talk more.
All this she had said, and with the earnestness of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their characters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and positively declared, that he would still love, and still hope Fanny knew her own meaning, but was no judge of her own manner.
All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.
All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it.
All this was bad, but she had still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund; when Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight communication with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned that he had actually written home to defer his return, having promised to remain some days longer with his friend.
All this was much helped by the abolition of the squalor which our immediate ancestors put up with so coolly; and by the leisurely, but not stupid, country-life which now grew (as I told you before) to be common amongst us.
All this, I say, pleased me hugely, and she was pleased at my pleasure - but rather puzzled too.
All thos who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the severes rivalry between the males of many species to attract, by singing, th females.
All those fine first feelings, of which he had hoped to be the exciter, were already given.
All vertebrate animals, all insects and some other larg groups of animals, pair for each birth.
All went well: she did not dislike her own looks; and when she came to the necklaces again, her good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross.
All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.
All were at least comely, and one of them very handsome and regular of feature.
All were attracted at first by the plants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy independence.
All who can distinguish will understand your motive.
All wolves, foxes jackals and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most eager t attack poultry, sheep and pigs; and this tendency has been found incurabl in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries such a Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the savages do not keep thes domestic animals.
All work which would be irksome to do by hand is done by immensely improved machinery; and in all work which it is a pleasure to do by hand machinery is done without.
Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.
Allow me to ask your pardon.
Allow me to stay here a little while, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act.
Allowance should invariably be made for the previous state of the instrument during some days as well as hours, because its indication may be affected by remote causes, or by changes close at hand.
Allowing 0,0011 of an inch for each foot.
Almos every part of every organic being is so beautifully related to its comple conditions of life that it seems as improbable that any part should hav been suddenly produced perfect, as that a complex machine should have bee invented by man in a perfect state.
Almost all oceani islands, even the most isolated and smallest, are inhabited by land-shells generally by endemic species, but sometimes by species found elsewher striking instances of which have been given by Dr. A.A. Gould in relatio to the Pacific.
Almost every year, as I am informed b Mr. E.V. Harcourt, many European and African birds are blown to Madeira this island is inhabited by ninety-nine kinds, of which one alone i peculiar, though very closely related to a European form; and three or fou other species are confined to this island and to the Canaries.
Almost every year, one or tw land-birds are blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America t the western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be transporte by these rare wanderers only by one means, namely, by dirt adhering t their feet or beaks, which is in itself a rare accident.
Along the Himalaya, at point 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing on ancient and giganti moraines.
Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a peculia marine fauna, tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no record o several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved t a distant age.
Along this whol space of the Cordillera true glaciers do not now exist even at much mor considerable heights.
Alph.
Alphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wid ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been expected, a they are exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they come int competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more importan circumstance) with different sets of organic beings.
Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord �was much about as tall as Peter;� at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn�t have seen his head if you had been there.
Also the banks of the forest that we passed through had lost their courtly game-keeperish trimness, and were as wild and beautiful as need he, though the trees were clearly well seen to.
Also when animals see sheltered places, instead of spreading over their usual range: when pig carry straw to their sties; and when smoke from chimneys does not ascen readily, (straight upwards during a calm,) an unfavourable change may b looked for.
Also, a bright yellow sky at sunset presages wind; a pale yellow, wet: and thus by the prevalence of red, yellow, or grey tints, the coming weather may be foretold very nearly, indeed, if aided by instruments, almost exactly.
Alternate rising and sinking show very unsettled weather.
Althoug I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet th rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock goose, etc., may be attributed in main part to selection not having bee brought into play:  in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; i donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little attentio paid to their breeding; for recently in certain parts of Spain and of th United States this animal has been surprisingly modified and improved b careful selection; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and  large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt i the display of distinct breeds; but the goose, under the conditions t which it is exposed when domesticated, seems to have a singularl inflexible organisation, though it has varied to a slight extent, as I hav elsewhere described.
Althoug organisation, on the whole, may have advanced and be still advancin throughout the world, yet the scale will always present many degrees o perfection; for the high advancement of certain whole classes, or o certain members of each class, does not at all necessarily lead to th extinction of those groups with which they do not enter into clos competition.
Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in thi volume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convinc experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of fact all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directl opposite to mine.
Although I know of hardly any thoroughly well-authenticated cases o perfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have reason to believe that the hybrid from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus colchicus with P. torquatus, are perfectly fertile.
Although New Zealand is her spoken of as an oceanic island, it is in some degree doubtful whether i should be so ranked; it is of large size, and is not separated fro Australia by a profoundly deep sea; from its geological character and th direction of its mountain ranges, the Rev. W.B. Clarke has latel maintained that this island, as well as New Caledonia, should be considere as appurtenances of Australia.
Although all the individuals o the same species differ in some slight degree from each other, it woul often be long before differences of the right nature in various parts o the organisation might occur.
Although eac formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for it deposition, several reasons can be given why each should not commonl include a graduated series of links between the species which lived at it commencement and close, but I cannot assign due proportional weight to th following considerations.
Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each probabl is short compared with the period requisite to change one species int another.
Although every part of the body varies slightly it does not follow that the necessary parts should always vary in the righ direction and to the right degree.
Although few of the most ancient species have lef modified descendants, yet, at remote geological periods, the earth may hav been almost as well peopled with species of many genera, families, order and classes, as at the present day.
Although fully trusting to the statements of Huber and Mr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind, as an one may well be excused for doubting the existence of so extraordinary a instinct as that of making slaves.
Although in most of these cases the two or three forms, both with animals and plants, are not now connecte by intermediate gradations, it is possible that they were once thu connected.
Although in oceanic islands the species are few in number, the proportio of endemic kinds (i.e.
Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still mor important, especially for the production of species which shall prov capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely.
Although many distinct genera within the same famil have been grafted together, in other cases species of the same genus wil not take on each other.
Although many statements may b found in works on natural history to this effect, I cannot find even on which seems to me of any weight.
Although much remains obscure and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the mos deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that th view which most naturalists until recently entertained, and which  formerly entertained - namely, that each species has been independentl created - is erroneous.
Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of eac being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as o very trifling importance, may thus be acted on.
Although new an important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogou variation, such modifications will add to the beautiful and harmoniou diversity of nature.
Although no graduated link of structure, fitted for gliding through the air, now connect th Galeopithecus with the other Insectivora, yet there is no difficulty i supposing that such links formerly existed, and that each was developed i the same manner as with the less perfectly gliding squirrels; each grade o structure having been useful to its possessor.
Although s small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it ferociousl attack other ants.
Although so few marine animals are common t the above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America an the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fishes range from the Pacific int the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of th Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa on almost exactly opposit meridians of longitude.
Although some species ma be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, fo the world would not hold them.
Although terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands aerial mammals do occur on almost every island.
Although the Government and Parliament had the law-courts, the army, and 'society' at their backs, the Committee of Public Safety began to be a force in the country, and really represented the producing classes.
Although the barometer generally falls with a Southerly, and rises with a Northerly wind, the contrary sometimes occurs; in which cases the Southerly wind is dry and the weather fine; or the Northerly wind is wet and violent.
Although the beak is thus ver inferior as a sifter to that of a shoveller, yet this bird, as every on knows, constantly uses it for this purpose.
Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally clean, earth sometime adheres to them:  in one case I removed sixty-one grains, and in anothe case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from the foot of  partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as the seed of  vetch.
Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have bee formed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any one; yet in the cas of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in complexity, eac good for its possessor, then under changing conditions of life, there is n logical impossibility in the acquirement of any conceivable degree o perfection through natural selection.
Although the fertility of varieties when intercrossed, and of their mongre offspring, has been asserted by so many authors to be universal, thi cannot be considered as quite correct after the facts given on the hig authority of Gartner and Kolreuter.
Although the mercury falls lowest before high winds, it frequently sinks considerably before heavy rain only.
Although the preceding remarks are probably sufficient for their principal purpose - these pages may fall into the hands of person familiar with the subject, to whom the following observations may be addressed, as some of the reasons for what has been so briefly, if not too positively outlined.
Although there is no evidence that any animal performs an action for th exclusive good of another species, yet each tries to take advantage of th instincts of others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structur of other species.
Although there will always be a struggle for life between th inhabitants of the same pond, however few in kind, yet as the number eve in a well-stocked pond is small in comparison with the number of specie inhabiting an equal area of land, the competition between them wil probably be less severe than between terrestrial species; consequently a intruder from the waters of a foreign country would have a better chance o seizing on a new place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists.
Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were.
Although tw countries may present physical conditions as closely similar as the sam species ever require, we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants bein widely different, if they have been for a long period completely sundere from each other; for as the relation of organism to organism is the mos important of all relations, and as the two countries will have receive colonists at various periods and in different proportions, from some othe country or from each other, the course of modification in the two area will inevitably have been different.
Although very many species have almost certainly been produced by steps no greater than those separating fine varieties; yet it may be maintained tha some have been developed in a different and abrupt manner.
Although we have no good evidence of the existence in organic beings of a innate tendency towards progressive development, yet this necessaril follows, as I have attempted to show in the fourth chapter, through th continued action of natural selection.
Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ coul not have been produced by successive, small, transitional gradations, ye undoubtedly serious cases of difficulty occur.
Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it.
Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which, if shown t an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, woul certainly be ranked by him as well-defined species.
Altogether no less than ten genera are enumerated, which include specie that imitate other butterflies.
Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.
Altogether there is the closest identity in character and behaviour betwee illegitimate plants and hybrids.
Altogether, out of the ninety-four drie plants, eighteen floated for above twenty-eight days; and some of th eighteen floated for a very much longer period.
Always some little objection, some little doubt, some little anxiety to be got over.
Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothing for your sister, Mr. Crawford.
Amelia deserves no better.
Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha.
Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure.
Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested, Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs. Price: he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny, though almost totally separated from her family, was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of anything at all promising in their situation or conduct.
Amidst all these gardens and houses it was of course impossible to trace the sites of the old streets: but it seemed to me that the main roadways were the same as of old.
Amidst such talk, driving quietly through the balmy evening, we came to Hammersmith, and were well received by our friends there.
Among birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character.
Among insects there are innumerable instances; thus Linnaeus, misled b external appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth.
Among mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in Bats and in a lesser degree in the Felidae and Canidae.
Among many animals sexual selection will have given its aid t ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted male the greatest number of offspring.
Among resident artists he enjoyed celebrity of a non-professional sort.
Among the pious, the queries of the philosopher were soon erected into doctrines of the church.
Among the vertebrata the degree o intellect and an approach in structure to man clearly come into play.
Amongst these were many children from six or eight years old up to sixteen or seventeen.
Amongst us, our differences concern matters of business, and passing events as to them, and could not divide men permanently.
An advantage this, a strengthener of love, in which even the conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal.
An affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who had hearts to value anything good.
An almost equally simple, though very different plan occurs i many plants in which a symmetrical flower secretes a few drops of nectar and is consequently visited by insects; and these carry the pollen from th anthers to the stigma.
An analogous explanation has been given by Mr. Wallace, of the equall complex case, of certain Malayan butterflies regularly appearing under tw or even three distinct female forms; and by Fritz Muller, of certai Brazilian crustaceans likewise appearing under two widely distinct mal forms.
An animal thus characterized has been slaughtered, but th breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has succeeded.
An argument of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally with the wil rock-pigeon in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts o their structure, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts; we ma look in vain through the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak lik that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or barb for reversed feathers like those of the Jacobin; for a crop like that o the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail.
An attachment, originally as tranquil as their tempers, was now become a mere name.
An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family connexions; continual engagements among them; commanding the first society in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even more than those of larger fortune, and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a tete-a-tete with the person one feels most agreeable in the world.
An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged.
An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from Northampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her good management of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming into a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and as two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to hope that none might ever be found.
An extraordinary amount of modificatio implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of variability, whic has continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit o the species.
An icicle must have got into the works.
An if there has been any variability under nature, it would be a unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play.
An in the case of fluid drawn off or diminished in weight at one end while increased by repletion at the other, the whole body of water will move similarly to that in the former vessel, but unequally.
An observer may be near a central point towards which the surrounding fluid tends, or from which it diverges.
An observer may be under the centre of such accumulation or depression, he may be more or less distant from it though within the influence of whatever horizontal movement of air may be caused by such temporary increase or diminution of pressure.
An odious, little, pert, unnatural, impudent girl.
An officer of a watch, with a good eye for clouds and signs of changing weather, may save his men a great deal of unnecessary exposure, as well as work, besides economising sails, spars, and rigging.
An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children�s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.
An organ fo vision must be formed of transparent tissue, and must include some sort o lens for throwing an image at the back of a darkened chamber.
An organ might also, be retained for one alone of its former functions.
An organ, serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterl aborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain perfectl efficient for the other.
An part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinar manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since th genus arose; and thus we can understand why it should often still b variable in a much higher degree than other parts; for variation is  long-continued and slow process, and natural selection will in such case not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variabilit and to reversion to a less modified state.
An uncle with whom she has been living so many years, and who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother, treating him, they say, quite like a son.
An what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally related to each other and clustered round certain forms - that is, round their parent-species.
Analogou facts could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.
Analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the sea.
Analogy from the consideration of dimorphic an trimorphic plants clearly leads to the same conclusion, for when the form are illegitimately united, they yield few or no seed, and their offsprin are more or less sterile; and these forms belong to the same undoubte species, and differ from each other in no respect except in thei reproductive organs and functions.
Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that al animals and plants are descended from some one prototype.
And Dick, from above on the bridge where he stood to watch her, saw a strange, equivocal smile dawn slowly on her face and pass away again at once and suddenly, leaving her as grave as ever; and the sense of distance, which it is so cruel for a lover to endure, pressed with every moment more heavily on her companion.
And Esther's bearing was more that of despair than that of love.
And Fanny, what was she doing and thinking all this while? and what was her opinion of the newcomers? Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny.
And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring, after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but not for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.
And I do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner.

And I do take leave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet again, it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve.
And I find tha several species in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-wate during seven days.
And I hope you will have a very agreeable day, and find it all mighty delightful.
And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition.
And I look at varieties which are in any degre more distinct and permanent, as steps toward more strongly marked an permanent varieties; and at the latter, as leading to sub-species, and the to species.
And I must say, that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion.
And I must tell you whatever quarrels or misunderstandings arise, they very seldom take place between people of different race; and consequently since there is less unreason in them, they are the more readily appeased.
And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots.
And I observed that she always spoke of you as 'Fanny,' which she was never used to do; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality.
And I sat watching how his eyes glittered, and how the fresh life seemed to glow in his face, and I wondered how at his age he should think of the happiness of the world, or indeed anything but his coming dinner.
And I saw a devilish pretty woman, by Gad.
And I saw you there, though you didn't see me.
And I see my kinsman Richard Hammond has an air about him as if he had brought you here for me to do something for you.
And Mr. Campbell was here at four o'clock to ask for you: he has got one of the Thrush's boats, and is going off to her at six, and hoped you would be here in time to go with him.
And O, my Father, now I thank thee that it has so often opened, to receive those dear ones who await me! And the star was shining; and it shines upon his grave.
And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.
And Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to.
And Sir Thomas's wishing just at first to be only with his family, is so very natural, that she can argue nothing from that.
And after this interval, variety a1 is supposed in th diagram to have produced variety a2, which will, owing to the principle o divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety a1.
And all the while Dick smilingly consented, understanding well that he was being done, but taking his losses in the pursuit of character as a hunter sacrifices his dogs.
And all thes circumstances are favourable to the production of new varieties.
And all these genera, descended from (A), form an order distinc from the genera descended from (I).
And all these gradations can be actually traced.
And all this we could no more help than the earthquake of the year before last.
And analogy would lead us to believe that th young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional an aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn would be apt to lay thei eggs in other birds' nests, and thus be more successful in rearing thei young.
And another of us (I won't name him) got fairly bitten with love-madness, and used to go about making himself as unpleasant as he could - not of malice prepense, of course; so that the girl, who liked him well enough at first, though she didn't love him, began fairly to dislike him.
And as for Fanny's just stepping down to my house for me -  it is not much above a quarter of a mile - I cannot think I was unreasonable to ask it.
And as for me, I am twenty years old.
And as for the pigments, well, I'll use them, some of these days; and to show that I'm in earnest, I'll get Dick here to prepare a canvas.
And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody.
And as for this necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it six times: it is very pretty, but I never think of it; and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on the very one which, if I have a choice, I would rather part with and see in your possession than any other.
And as foreigners hav thus in every country beaten some of the natives, we may safely conclud that the natives might have been modified with advantage, so as to hav better resisted the intruders.
And as it is not likel that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and sub-breed with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts, the resul must, I think, be due to habit.
And as natural selection works solely b and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments wil tend to progress towards perfection.
And as soon as the girl was gone upon this hospitable intent, the old woman crossed the room and came quite near to Dick as if in menace.
And as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains, th arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground, alway ascending, as the warmth increased and the snow still further disappeared higher and higher, whilst their brethren were pursuing their norther journey.
And as they were in many ways still very powerful, or seemed so to be; they still hoped by means of brute force to regain some of what they had lost, and perhaps in the end the whole of it.
And as to coming away at night, you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses.
And as to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks, I shall think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he.
And as to the salmon, why, neighbour, my friend here, who comes from the outlands, was quite surprised yesterday morning when I told him we had plenty of salmon at Hammersmith.
And as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facilit with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknow differences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the still mor complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are incidental o unknown differences in their reproductive systems.
And at least, in one way or the other, here was the dangerous beginning of a separation between two hearts.
And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers� shops.
And at times it may fall considerably with polar winds and fine weather, apparently against thes rules, because a continuance of equatorial wind is about to follow.
And being always with her, and always talking confidentially, and his feelings exactly in that favourable state which a recent disappointment gives, those soft light eyes could not be very long in obtaining the pre-eminence.
And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.
And besides, I want to play something more to you - a very pretty piece - and your cousin Edmund's prime favourite.
And besides, he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush before she went out of harbour - the Thrush was certainly the finest sloop in the service - and there were several improvements in the dockyard, too, which he quite longed to shew her.
And besides, it is all he cares for; let him take it, and let me never hear from him again.
And besides, these students are generally such pleasant people; so kind and sweet tempered; so humble, and at the same time so anxious to teach everybody all that they know.
And bide the end! �Have they no refuge or resource?� cried Scrooge.
And by the way, I saw that the silver had oxydised, and was like a blackleaded stove in colour.
And conversely, that natura selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing an organ withou requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some adjoining part.
And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.
And even now, when all is won and has been for a long time, my heart is sickened with thinking of all the waste of life that has gone on for so many years.
And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.
And for a few minutes he did say nothing.
And from what I have seen I should suppose that your marketing, great and little, is carried on in a way that makes it a pleasant occupation.
And geology tells u that some of the lowest forms, as the infusoria and rhizopods, hav remained for an enormous period in nearly their present state.
And had I had an idea of it, nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace.
And hardly had the carriage turned the corner and rattled into the high road with this inexplicable pair, than the whistle broke forth - prolonged, and low and tremulous; and the groom, already so far relieved, vented the rest of his surprise in one simple English word, friendly to the mouth of Jack-tar and the sooty pitman, and hurried to spread the news round the servants' hall of Naseby House.
And he and the editor made post-haste for the country town.
And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine.
And he fawned upon Dick with his hands.
And he is not an acquaintance of to-day; you have now known him some time.
And he laughed loud and merrily, as if the idea of being paid for his work was a very funny joke.
And he led the way upstairs, and opening a door we went into a fair-sized room of the old type, as plain as the rest of the house, with a few necessary pieces of furniture, and those very simple and even rude, but solid and with a good deal of carving about them, well designed but rather crudely executed.
And he said, 'I am.
And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.
And he sobbed.
And he stretched out his arms and cried, 'O, mother, sister, and brother, I am here! Take me!' And they answered him, 'Not yet,' and the star was shining.
And he walked off briskly towards the inn, leaving Dick alone with Esther on the road.
And here the importance of th principle of benefit derived from divergence of character comes in; fo this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variation (represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated b natural selection.
And i may be asked what advantage, as far as we can see, would it be to a infusorian animalcule - to an intestinal worm - or even to an earth-worm, t be highly organised.
And if I have good luck, your mother shall have some.
And if those classes had really been incapable of being touched by that instinct which produced the passion for freedom and equality aforesaid, what would have happened, I think, would have been this: that a certain part of the working classes would have been so far improved in condition that they would have approached the condition of the middling rich men; but below them would have been a great class of most miserable slaves, whose slavery would have been far more hopeless than the older class-slavery had been.
And if w reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have bee cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most differen climates and treatment, we are driven to conclude that this grea variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised unde conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those t which the parent species had been exposed under nature.
And if, in every separate territory, hardl any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between th consecutive formations, we may infer that this could nowhere b ascertained.
And in a minute or two Dick and Clara came to me, the latter looking most fresh and beautiful in a light silk embroidered gown, which to my unused eyes was extravagantly gay and bright; while Dick was also handsomely dressed in white flannel prettily embroidered.
And in effect the Golden Dustman hailed us from the hall-door; so we all got up and went into the porch, before which, with a strong grey horse in the shafts, stood a carriage ready for us which I could not help noticing.
And in like manner as to other parts in whic there appears to exist an adaptation to an end.
And in the distant future, a geologist, examining these beds would be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of th embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period, instead o having been really far greater, that is, extending from before the glacia epoch to the present day.
And in the meantime Dick learned more about his acquaintance on all sides: heard of his yacht, his chaise and four, his brief season of celebrity amid a more confiding population, his daughter, of whom he loved to whimper in his cups, his sponging, parasitical, nameless way of life; and with each new detail something that was not merely interest nor yet altogether affection grew up in his mind towards this disreputable stepson of the arts.
And in the midst of all this turmoil, a sense of unpardonable injustice remained graven in his memory.
And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.
And in this case, it is not at al surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone o increasing.
And in this last Dick shuddered to identify his father's chestnut.
And indeed, rightly considered, this interest of his was an artistic interest.
And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be - I mean before my uncle went abroad.
And it is in fresh wate basins that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a onc preponderant order:  and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalou forms now known in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren which, like fossils, connect to a certain extent orders at present widel separated in the natural scale.
And it seems to me that nothing less than a long list of such cases i sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular case like that of th bat.
And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly.
And it was clear he meant to do it.
And it would appear from information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray and Mr. Wollaston, that generally, when varieties intermediate between tw other forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms whic they connect.
And just then the Admiral perceived a house by the wayside, and something depending over the house door which might be construed as a sign by the hopeful and thirsty.
And let me tell you, my friend, that I can see you are too apt to fall into mere dreamy musing: no doubt because you are not yet used to our life of repose amidst of energy; of work which is pleasure and pleasure which is work.
And look, there is a ferry! I told her the name of it, as I slowed off to put the ferry-chain over our heads; and on we went passing by a bank clad with oak trees on our left hand, till the stream narrowed again and deepened, and we rowed on between walls of tall reeds, whose population of reed sparrows and warblers were delightfully restless, twittering and chuckling as the wash of the boats stirred the reeds from the water upwards in the still, hot morning.
And my friend does not manage him well; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it.
And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand.
And now I order you to tell me how far things have gone, and whither you have smuggled my unhappy son.
And now I'm afraid I have made you feel uncomfortable.
And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.
And now again I was busy looking about me, for we were quite clear of Piccadilly Market, and were in a region of elegantly-built much ornamented houses, which I should have called villas if they had been ugly and pretentious, which was very far from being the case.
And now he wished to order her to bed in her own house! now he called her puss! now, even as he uttered the words, toppling on his chair, he broke the stem of his tobacco-pipe in three! Never did the sheep turn upon her shearer with a more commanding front.
And now on of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middl of the secondary series; and true mammals have been discovered in the ne red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series.
And now the slayer in his turn is so upset that he is like to kill himself; and if he does, the girl will do as much, I fear.
And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker�s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.
And now you must be off for Spithead too.
And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you any longer.
And now, do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own.
And now, my dear Fanny, this subject is closed between us.
And now, the world had grown old and wiser, and I was to see my hope realised at last So on we went, Dick rowing in an easy tireless way, and Clara sitting by my side admiring his manly beauty and heartily good-natured face, and thinking, I fancy, of nothing else.
And of the species now living very few will transmi progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which al organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species i each genus, and all the species in many genera, have left no descendants but have become utterly extinct.
And on another account, too, I can perfectly comprehend.
And on the other hand, it was just for the possession of that wealth that 'the rebels' were fighting, and I should have thought, especially when they saw that they were winning, that they would have been careful to destroy as little as possible of what was so soon to be their own.
And one night as he lay upon his bed, his children standing round, he cried, as he had cried so long ago 'I see the star! They whispered one another, 'He is dying.
And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge�s clerk�s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit�s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch.
And please laugh; only tell me.
And really I don't see why you should fall foul of Maple-Durham lock, which I think a very pretty place.
And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already, there is a great deal more for you to learn.
And she began to step forward on her way.
And she gave him her hand, with a sort of curtsy.
And she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not attending to Fanny's last question of whether she had seen anything of Miss Crawford and Edmund.
And so it was! God love it, so it was In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker�s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.
And so on we went up the Thames still - or whither On we went.
And such instances o diversity of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature.
And such instances occu in nature.
And such ne places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasiona immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more importan degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with th new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other.
And such was Fanny's dependence on his words, that for five minutes she thought they had done.
And the Admiral stood forth in a halo.
And the barometer, after very little practice, can be used by any man.
And the cases jus given, more especially that of the pigeons, show that the characteristi differences which have been accumulated by man's selection, and which giv value to his breeds, do not generally appear at a very early period o life, and are inherited at a corresponding not early period.
And the harder, more greasy, rolled, tufted or ragged the clouds, the stronger the coming wind will prove.
And the house itself was a fit guardian for all the beauty of this heart of summer.
And the humbug himself? Do you fancy he was easier in his mind? I am sure, on the other hand, that he was acutely miserable; and he betrayed his sufferings by a perfectly silly and undignified access of temper, during which he broke his pipe in several pieces, threw his brandy and water in the fire, and employed words which were very plain although the drift of them was somewhat vague.
And the man who had been the child saw his daughter, newly lost to him, a celestial creature among those three, and he said, 'My daughter's head is on my sister's bosom, and her arm is around my mother's neck, and at her feet there is the baby of old time, and I can bear the parting from her, GOD be praised! And the star was shining.
And the next day did bring a surprise to her.
And the old fellow chuckled again, and at last fairly burst out laughing.
And the other, that you will often call on Mrs. Grant, and make her amends for my being gone.
And the star, opening, showed him a great world of light, where many more such angels waited to receive them.
And the tw or more parent-species are supposed to be descended from some one specie of an earlier genus.
And the two new families, o orders, are descended from two species of the original genus; and these ar supposed to be descended from some still more ancient and unknown form.
And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.
And then he will look across at his daughter's portrait, a photograph, shake his head with an amused appearance, and mix himself another grog by way of consolation.
And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change - not a knocker, but Marley's face.
And then the door closed behind her, and Dick was alone in the darkness.
And then the poor horses too! To see them straining away! You know how I always feel for the horses.
And then we got into the carriage, Dick shook the reins, and we got under way at once, Greylocks trotting soberly between the lovely trees of the London streets, that were sending floods of fragrance into the cool evening air; for it was now getting toward sunset.
And then you did yourself injustice when you spoke just now.
And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one's power to pay off the debts of one's sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman's nature to refuse such a triumph.
And then, about half-past one, the candle she had been thus intently watching flared up into a last blaze of paper, and she leaped to her feet with an ejaculation, looked about her once, blew out the light, turned round, and was heard rapidly mounting the staircase in the dark.
And then, her air, her manner, her tout ensemble, is so indescribably improved! She must be grown two inches, at least, since October.
And there is your father at the door! She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter - he had need of it, poor fellow - came in.
And there must be your approach, through what is at present the garden.
And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it! The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded.
And therewith I took a handful of money out of my pocket, as one does in a foreign country.
And therewith he took Clara's hand, and led her down the bent.
And therewith he turned and swung himself out of the hall.
And therewith we gave them good day and went out of the booth.
And thes conditions have, it is probable, been largely determined through natura selection.
And they ar wholly inexplicable on any other view.
And they are quite in the light, for it would be a very pretty establishment for them.
And they think she will have her orders in a day or two.
And they went on in silence through Kirton hamlet, where an old man followed them with his eyes, and perhaps envied them their youth and love; and across the Ivy beck where the mill was splashing and grumbling low thunder to itself in the chequered shadow of the dell, and the miller before the door was beating flour from his hands as he whistled a modulation; and up by the high spinney, whence they saw the mountains upon either hand; and down the hill again to the back courts and offices of Naseby House.
And they were forced to meet it by a measure hostile to the masters, the establishment of government factories for the production of necessary wares, and markets for their sale.
And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness.
And this certainly holds tru if varieties be looked at as incipient species; for my tables clearly show as a general rule, that, wherever many species of a genus have been formed the species of that genus present a number of varieties, that is, o incipient species, beyond the average.
And this continuity o the circumpolar land, with the consequent freedom under a more favourabl climate for intermigration, will account for the supposed uniformity of th sub-arctic and temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at a perio anterior to the Glacial epoch.
And this fac shows that a character, which is generally of generic value, when it sink in value and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, thoug its physiological importance may remain the same.
And this is the case with some of the America cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the Europea cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding country.
And this is the rule of development i certain whole groups, or in certain sub-groups alone, as with cuttle-fish land-shells, fresh-water crustaceans, spiders, and some members of th great class of insects.
And this is why there is a new household and a brand-new baby in Naseby Dower House; and why the great Van Tromp lives in pleasant style upon the shores of England; and why twenty-six individual copies of the Thymebury Star are received daily at the door of Naseby House.
And this undoubtedly is the case.
And this, I a convinced, is the case.
And this, perhaps, might have bee anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country, th species which are already dominant will be the most likely to yiel offspring, which, though in some slight degree modified, still inheri those advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over thei compatriots.
And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good scholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable, I see him to be an indolent, selfish bon vivant, who must have his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder, is out of humour with his excellent wife.
And though of course I cannot force any special kind of knowledge upon them, yet, my Friend, I cannot help thinking that just as they might be like me in body, so I might impress upon them some part of my ways of thinking; that is, indeed, some of the essential part of myself; that part which was not mere moods, created by the matters and events round about me.
And though there was no second glance to disturb her, though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable, she could not get the better of her embarrassment, heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it, and had no composure till he turned away to some one else.
And thus, th forms of life throughout the universe become divided into group subordinate to groups.
And thus, th strange fact of an increase of fertility in the successive generations o ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED hybrids, in contrast with those spontaneously self fertilised, may, as I believe, be accounted for by too close interbreedin having been avoided.
And thus, when the two sets becam commingled in the equatorial regions, during the alternations of th Glacial periods, the northern forms were the more powerful and were able t hold their places on the mountains, and afterwards migrate southward wit the southern forms; but not so the southern in regard to the norther forms.
And to behold him now, seeking small loans with plaintive condescension, sponging for breakfast on an art-student of nineteen, a fallen Don Juan who had neglected to die at the propitious hour, had a colour of romance for young imaginations.
And upon the whole, it would certainly have gone off wonderfully.
And we all three turned toward the door of the Guest House.
And we are led to thi conclusion, which has been arrived at by many naturalists under th designation of single centres of creation, by various genera considerations, more especially from the importance of barriers of al kinds, and from the analogical distribution of subgenera, genera, an families.
And we ca understand this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members of th class, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one par as we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
And we can clearly understand these analogies, if species onc existed as varieties, and thus originated; whereas, these analogies ar utterly inexplicable if species are independent creations.
And we have evidence of aberran groups having suffered severely from extinction, for they are almost alway represented by extremely few species; and such species as do occur ar generally very distinct from each other, which again implies extinction.
And we have just seen that in several species of the horse genu the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than i the old.
And we have now see that Mr. Croll's conclusion that successive Glacial periods in the on hemisphere coincide with warmer periods in the opposite hemisphere together with the admission of the slow modification of species, explains  multitude of facts in the distribution of the same and of the allied form of life in all parts of the globe.
And we have seen in the chapte on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most closely-allie forms, - varieties of the same species, and species of the same genus o related genera, - which, from having nearly the same structure, constitutio and habits, generally come into the severest competition with each other.
And we know that eac species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countles seeds; and is thus striving, as it may be said, to the utmost to increas in number.
And we see that this is the standard o perfection attained under nature.
And what an acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! Equally in brother and sister deceived! I thank you for your patience, Fanny.
And what do you say, ma'am, to the chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example, and such things are very catching.
And when I have done with her I must go to her sister, Lady Stornaway, because she was rather my most particular friend of the two, but I have not cared much for her these three years.
And when a cross has been made, the closest selection is fa more indispensable even than in ordinary cases.
And when did you get anything to eat? And what would you like to have now? I could not tell whether you would be for some meat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would have got something ready.
And when farther pressed, had added, that in her opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted for each other by nature, education, and habit.
And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you think I did? You will laugh at me; but I got out and walked up.
And why it was not done already she could not devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay.
And why, Dick? She is my daughter, of course; but then I am a man of the world and a man of taste, and perfectly qualified to give an opinion with impartiality - yes, Dick, with impartiality.
And why? Because my father had made a bigger ass of himself than I supposed.
And with regard to their influencing public manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of refinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life.
And with that he strode from the station, all in a glow of passion and virtue.
And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny to her fate, a fate which, had not Fanny's heart been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she deserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young ladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent, manner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them, or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition, and so much taste as belonged to her, she could have escaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the courtship only of a fortnight) of such a man as Crawford, in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him to be overcome, had not her affection been engaged elsewhere.
And yet - once an artist always an artist.
And yet I believe I am as much cut up as you are.
And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there is always a girl under her, and I often do half the work myself.
And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.
And yet he still waited, straining his ears, and with terror and sickness at his heart; for if Esther had followed her father, if she had even made one movement in this great conspiracy of men and nature to be still, Dick must have had instant knowledge of it from his station before the door; and if she had not moved, must she not have fainted? or might she not be dead He could hear the cottage clock deliberately measure out the seconds; time stood still with him; an almost superstitious terror took command of his faculties; at last, he could bear no more, and, springing through the little garden in two bounds, he put his face against the window.
And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time.
And yet, that I must and would confess that, could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before, I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem.
And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son.
And you know you had Chapman to help you to dress.
And you may say, if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return, in compassion to his feelings, as I know his horse will lose.
And you must be aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman's duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this.
And you say I loved you; I loved my father's friend.
And you see this ferrying and giving people casts about the water is my business, which I would do for anybody; so to take gifts in connection with it would look very queer.
And you see, in this matter we need not grudge a few poorish buildings standing, because we can always build elsewhere; nor need we be anxious as to the breeding of pleasant work in such matters, for there is always room for more and more work in a new building, even without making it pretentious.
And, Fanny, though I hope I do justice to my sisters' good qualities, I think it very possible that they might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by Crawford, and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent.
And, and - we think very differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply.
And, as if to make the case a striking as possible, this cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one species has as yet been foun even in any tertiary stratum.
And, in the meantime, Van Tromp ran on interminably.
And, oh, don't spoil the pleasure of your coming home to me; show me that you can be my father and yet not neglect your destiny.
And, on the other hand, the agree most closely in many important respects.
And, you know, I mustn't preach to you, but surely it wouldn't be right for you to take away people's pleasure of studying your attire, by just going and making yourself like everybody else.
Andrew Knight observed that hi bees, instead of laboriously collecting propolis, used a cement of wax an turpentine, with which he had covered decorticated trees.
Aneroid barometers, if often compared with good mercurial columns, are similar in their indications, and valuable; but it must be remembered that they are not independent instruments; that they are set originall by a barometer, require adjustment occasionally, and may deteriorate in time, though slowly.
Aneroids, metallic barometers, and oil sympiesometers, seem to be much more affected than mercurial barometers by electrical changes.
Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions, and acting on them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking of him continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had.
Angry she was: bitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received such an offer than for refusing it.
Animal kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for their ow subsistence, and are exposed to a certain extent to natural selection, an individuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed best unde different climates.
Animals not far remote from ordinary forms, prepare th transition from light to darkness.
Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and evergreen trees plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for extremely differen climates, can often be crossed with ease.
Another blind genus (Anophthalmus) offers thi remarkable peculiarity, that the species, as Mr. Murray observes, have no as yet been found anywhere except in caves; yet those which inhabit th several caves of Europe and America are distinct; but it is possible tha the progenitors of these several species, while they were furnished wit eyes, may formerly have ranged over both continents, and then have becom extinct, excepting in their present secluded abodes.
Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of that great black word miserable, which served to introduce it, Sir Thomas began to think a little relenting, a little change of inclination, might have something to do with it; and to augur favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself.
Another day my attention was struc by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the same spot, and evidentl not in search of food; they approached and were vigorously repulsed by a independent community of the slave species (F. fusca); sometimes as many a three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea.
Another deal proceeded, and Crawford began again about Thornton Lacey.
Another distinguished palaeontologist, M. Gaudry, ha shown in the most striking manner that many of the fossil mammal discovered by him in Attica serve to break down the intervals betwee existing genera.
Another distinguished zoologist, the late Professor Claparede, has argue in the same manner, and has arrived at the same result.
Another familiar instance is that of the fly which walks on the ceiling with feet that stick.
Another general rule requires attention; which is, that the wind usuall veers, shifts, or goes round, with the sun, (right-handed in northern places, left-handed in the southern parts of the world,) and that, when it does not do so, or backs, more wind or bad weather may be expected instead of improvement.
Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.
Another interesting relation exists, namely, between the depth of the se separating islands from each other, or from the nearest continent, and th degree of affinity of their mammalian inhabitants.
Another laugh.
Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of the house, and in her mother's arms, who met her there with looks of true kindness, and with features which Fanny loved the more, because they brought her aunt Bertram's before her, and there were her two sisters: Susan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest of the family, about five - both glad to see her in their way, though with no advantage of manner in receiving her.
Another quarter of an hour brought her a great deal more.
Another short fit of abstraction followed, when, shaking it off, she thus attacked her companion.
Another species of Lobelia, whic is visited by bees, seeds freely in my garden.
Another species, Formica sanguinea, was likewise first discovered by P. Huber to be a slave-making ant.
Another summer will hardly improve it to me.
Another week, only one other week, would have been enough for us.
Ants, however, work by inherited instincts and by inherite organs or tools, while man works by acquired knowledge and manufacture instruments.
Anxious not to appear unhappy, she soon recovered herself; and wiping away her tears, was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of his dress; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on shore some part of every day before they sailed, and even of getting her to Spithead to see the sloop.
Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.
Any change in structure and function, which can be effected by smal stages, is within the power of natural selection; so that an orga rendered, through changed habits of life, useless or injurious for on purpose, might be modified and used for another purpose.
Any number of instances could b given of the varying importance for classification of the same importan organ within the same group of beings.
Any on whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplaine difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts wil certainly reject the theory.
Any one may of course, deny that the teeth in either case have been adapted for tearin flesh, through the natural selection of successive variations; but if thi be admitted in the one case, it is unintelligible to me that it should b denied in the other.
Any one may readily convinc himself of the efficiency of insect agency by examining the flowers of th more sterile kinds of hybrid Rhododendrons, which produce no pollen, for h will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers.
Any room in this house might suffice.
Any tendency to modification will also have been checked by intercrossin with the unmodified immigrants, often arriving from the mother-country.
Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us.
Anybody but myself would have made something more of it, and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle never did admire you till now - and now he does.
Anyhow, he kept on pressing us to stay over and over again, till at last we did not get away till the cool of the evening.
Anyhow, it was there, and they soon got leaders far more than equal to the best men amongst the reactionaries.
Anything but that, my dear Tom.
Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches.
Apart from his colonial career, he had been to Greece in a brigantine with four brass carronades; he had travelled Europe in a chaise and four, drawing bridle at the palace-doors of German princes; queens of song and dance had followed him like sheep and paid his tailor's bills.
Apart from the other pleasures of it, it gives them a little rough work, which I am sorry to say is getting somewhat scarce for these last fifty years.
Apart from this, which made him an exacting companion, he was one of the most upright, hot-tempered, hot-headed old gentlemen in England.
Are the Committee to understand that you are of opinion that every ship ought to have a barometer on board?
Are these the shadows of the things that will be, or are they shadows of things that may be, only? Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.
Arrangements were then made, in accordance with the views of the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, for the supply of instruments properly tested.
As Bronn gives the length of the ears and tail in th several species of mice as instances, though trifling ones, of difference in structure which can be of no special use, I may mention that, accordin to Dr. Schobl, the external ears of the common mouse are supplied in a extraordinary manner with nerves, so that they no doubt serve as tactil organs; hence the length of the ears can hardly be quite unimportant.
As Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying a real disappointment, she was rather in expectation, from her knowledge of Miss Crawford's temper, of being urged again; and though no second letter arrived for the space of a week, she had still the same feeling when it did come.
As Fries has well remarked, little groups o species are generally clustered like satellites around other species.
As Gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in differen INDIVIDUALS of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret believes thi to be the case with different individuals of the same two species in bein grafted together.
As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing: I have offended them, and they will not hear me; but when I have put them in good-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for.
As I couldn't explain why, I held my tongue.
As I eyed the pile of clothes, I could see the gleam of gold and silk embroidery on it, and judged that some of these workmen had tastes akin to those of the Golden Dustman of Hammersmith.
As I have little doubt of your feeling for us, my dear Fanny, under these distressing circumstances, I will write again very soon.
As I passed him he touched his hat with some real goodwill and courtesy, and much servility.
As I spoke, I heard footsteps near the door; the latch yielded, and in came our two lovers, looking so handsome that one had no feeling of shame in looking on at their little-concealed love-making; for indeed it seemed as if all the world must be in love with them.
As I stood there Ellen detached herself from our happy friends who still stood on the little strand and came up to me.
As I told this lie from pure politeness, in came the lad again, with a tray in his hands, on which I saw a long flask and two beautiful glasses.
As I told you, the rank and file of the army was not to be trusted by the reactionists; but the officers generally were prepared for anything, for they were mostly the very stupidest men in the country.
As I was putting the first mouthfuls into my mouth my eye caught a carved and gilded inscription on the panelling, behind what we should have called the High Table in an Oxford college hall, and a familiar name in it forced me to read it through.
As Lyell has wel remarked, the extent and thickness of our sedimentary formations are th result and the measure of the denudation which the earth's crust ha elsewhere undergone.
As Mr. Rushworth did not come, the injury was increased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.
As Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm.
As Professor Owen has remarked, ther is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there ar several in this state.
As Richard came in, he opened and shut his mouth like a codfish, and his eyes protruded.
As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.
As a blind species of Bathyscia is found in abundanc on shady rocks far from caves, the loss of vision in the cave species o this one genus has probably had no relation to its dark habitation; for i is natural that an insect already deprived of vision should readily becom adapted to dark caverns.
As a daughter, he hoped a penitent one, she should be protected by him, and secured in every comfort, and supported by every encouragement to do right, which their relative situations admitted; but farther than that he could not go.
As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be more unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments himself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried repeatedly before he could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he thought well of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have his own children's merits set off by the depreciation of hers.
As a record of a former state of things, I have retained in the foregoin paragraphs, and elsewhere, several sentences which imply that naturalist believe in the separate creation of each species; and I have been muc censured for having thus expressed myself.
As a rule, the immediate outcome shows which opinion on a given subject is the right one; it is a matter of fact, not of speculation.
As a rule, they don't do much reading, except for a few story-books, till they are about fifteen years old; we don't encourage early bookishness: though you will find some children who will take to books very early; which perhaps is not good for them; but it's no use thwarting them; and very often it doesn't last long with them, and they find their level before they are twenty years old.
As a single bu out of many thousands produced year after year on the same tree unde uniform conditions, has been known suddenly to assume a new character; an as buds on distinct trees, growing under different conditions, hav sometimes yielded nearly the same variety - for instance, buds on peach trees producing nectarines, and buds on common roses producing moss-roses - we clearly see that the nature of the conditions is of subordinat importance in comparison with the nature of the organism in determinin each particular form of variation; perhaps of not more importance than th nature of the spark, by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited, ha in determining the nature of the flames.
As a sister, so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of what she said, and in another light so triumphant and secure, she was in every way an object of painful alarm.
As a vast number o species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed with this kind o sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent condition in many plant which have not become climbers.
As according to the theory of natural selection an interminable number o intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the species i each group by gradations as fine as our existing varieties, it may b asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us?  Why are no all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos?  With respec to existing forms, we should remember that we have no right to expec (excepting in rare cases) to discover DIRECTLY connecting links betwee them, but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form.
As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same advantage which made their parent successful in life, they will generally go o multiplying in number as well as diverging in character:  this i represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceedin from (A).
As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived, ca be arranged within a few great classes; and as all within each class have according to our theory, been connected together by fine gradations, th best, and, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possibl arrangement, would be genealogical; descent being the hidden bond o connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the Natura System.
As all the species of the same genus are supposed to be descended from  common progenitor, it might be expected that they would occasionally var in an analogous manner; so that the varieties of two or more species woul resemble each other, or that a variety of one species would resemble i certain characters another and distinct species, this other species being according to our view, only a well-marked and permanent variety.
As all these mark are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no one wil doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet analogou variation appearing in the several breeds.
As allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area, ar generally distributed in such a manner that each has a wide range, with  comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which they becom rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not essentiall differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to both; and if w take a varying species inhabiting a very large area, we shall have to adap two varieties to two large areas, and a third variety to a narro intermediate zone.
As an example, I have attempted to show how potent has been th influence of the Glacial period on the distribution of the same and o allied species throughout the world.
As animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances of superiority undescribable.
As buds give rise b growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on al sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been wit the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches th crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever-branching an beautiful ramifications.
As children, their sister had been always very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon followed by the death of their common parent, which left them to the care of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she had scarcely seen them since.
As descent has universally been used in classing together the individual of the same species, though the males and females and larvae are sometime extremely different; and as it has been used in classing varieties whic have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable amount o modification, may not this same element of descent have been unconsciousl used in grouping species under genera, and genera under higher groups, al under the so-called natural system?  I believe it has been unconsciousl used; and thus only can I understand the several rules and guides whic have been followed by our best systematists.
As during these months, the slaves are very few in number, I thought that the might behave differently when more numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me tha he has watched the nests at various hours during May, June and August, bot in Surrey and Hampshire, and has never seen the slaves, though present i large numbers in August, either leave or enter the nest.
As each species tends by its geometrical rate of reproduction to increas inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each specie will be enabled to increase by as much as they become more diversified i habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many and widel different places in the economy of nature, there will be a constan tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring o any one species.
As exemplifying the effects of climatical changes on distribution, I hav attempted to show how important a part the last Glacial period has played which affected even the equatorial regions, and which, during th alternations of the cold in the north and the south, allowed th productions of opposite hemispheres to mingle, and left some of the stranded on the mountain-summits in all parts of the world.
As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, th conditions of life appear to act in two ways - directly on the whol organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting th reproductive system.
As far as instinct alon is concerned, the wonderful difference in this respect between the worker and the perfect females would have been better exemplified by the hive-bee.
As far as mere inorganic condition are concerned, it seems probable that a sufficient number of species woul soon become adapted to all considerable diversities of heat, moisture etc.; but I fully admit that the mutual relations of organic beings ar more important; and as the number of species in any country goes o increasing, the organic conditions of life must become more and mor complex.
As far as she could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all: he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom, more talent and taste than Mr. Yates.
As far as the mere enunciation of th principle of natural selection is concerned, it is quite immaterial whethe or not Professor Owen preceded me, for both of us, as shown in thi historical sketch, were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells and Mr. Matthews.
As far as the passing hour went, perhaps they were right in this.
As far as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughly benevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others; but her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.
As for Dick, it seemed to him as if his life had come abruptly to an end.
As for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make amends for deficiencies at home, there were none within the circle of her father's and mother's acquaintance to afford her the smallest satisfaction: she saw nobody in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own shyness and reserve.
As for his killing himself, you need not be afraid of that; for, from all you tell me, he is really very much in love with the woman; and to speak plainly, until his love is satisfied, he will not only stick to life as tightly as he can, but will also make the most of every event of his life - will, so to say, hug himself up in it; and I think that this is the real explanation of his taking the whole matter with such an excess of tragedy.
As for me I felt young again, and strange hopes of my youth were mingling with the pleasure of the present; almost destroying it, and quickening it into something like pain.
As for me, I was now looking at him harder than good manners allowed of; perhaps; for in truth his face, dried-apple-like as it was, seemed strangely familiar to me; as if I had seen it before - in a looking-glass it might be, said I to myself.
As for old Hammond, he looked on them like an artist who has just painted a picture nearly as well as he thought he could when he began it, and was perfectly happy.
As for sounds, the silence was unbroken save by the chant of the telegraph wires and the crying of the plovers on the waste.
As for the Committee of Public Safety, whatever they thought of their position, they had now gone too far to draw back; and many of them, it seems, thought that the government would not act.
As for the ball, so near at hand, she had too many agitations and fears to have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had, or must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking forward to the same event in situations more at ease, but under circumstances of less novelty, less interest, less peculiar gratification, than would be attributed to her.
As for the main subject of the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation.
As for the strange things, the reader will be relieved to hear that they were no stranger than might have been expected, and he may find things quite as strange without the expense of a Van Tromp for guide.
As for you, Esther, you take after your mother; you have a morbid sense of duty, particularly for others; strive against it, my dear - strive against it.
As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to an animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to animals havin subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with the adhesion of th eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage and if so, natural selection would aid the effects of disuse.
As geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physica changes, we might have expected to find that organic beings have varie under nature, in the same way as they have varied under domestication.
As has always been my practice, I have sought light on this head from ou domestic productions.
As he came up smiling towards us, I saw with pleasure that I must give up the Colney Hatch theory as to the waterman, for no two madmen ever behaved as they did before a sane man.
As he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are all against him, he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his.
As he extends th range of his observations he will meet with more cases of difficulty; fo he will encounter a greater number of closely-allied forms.
As he got there the day began to dawn, and he leaned over a hurdle and beheld the shadows flee away.
As he has done so well by Smith, I think I had better have him at once.
As he left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty, about eight and nine years old, rushed into it just released from school, and coming eagerly to see their sister, and tell that the Thrush was gone out of harbour; Tom and Charles.
As he said this, each looked towards their mother.
As he sat in that vapour-bath of hurried and discontented humanity, a carriage of the underground railway, he, like others, stewed discontentedly, while in self-reproachful mood he turned over the many excellent and conclusive arguments which, though they lay at his fingers' ends, he had forgotten in the just past discussion.
As he spoke, we came suddenly out of the woodland into a short street of handsomely built houses, which my companion named to me at once as Piccadilly: the lower part of these I should have called shops, if it had not been that, as far as I could see, the people were ignorant of the arts of buying and selling.
As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.
As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building.
As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it was pretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she showed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little trouble.
As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, an have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, it ca hardly be doubted that they must occasionally, as suggested by Lyell, hav transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarcti regions; and during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperat regions to another.
As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily act by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life ove other forms, there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendant of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descen their predecessors and their original progenitor.
As in hybridisation, so wit grafting, the capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one ha been able to graft together trees belonging to quite distinct families and, on the other hand, closely allied species and varieties of the sam species, can usually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease.
As in many widely separated families of plants, single species an single genera possess the power of revolving, and have thus become twiners they must have independently acquired it, and cannot have inherited it fro a common progenitor.
As in most groups of animals, important organs, such as those fo propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for propagating th race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly serviceabl in classification; but in some groups all these, the most important vita organs, are found to offer characters of quite subordinate value.
As in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting a union is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting.
As in repeating a well-known song, so in instincts, on action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a person be interrupted in  song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is generally forced to go bac to recover the habitual train of thought:  so P. Huber found it was with  caterpillar, which makes a very complicated hammock; for if he took  caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage o construction, and put it into a hammock completed up only to the thir stage, the caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixt stages of construction.
As in the case o flowers, I have as yet failed, after consultation with one of the highes authorities, namely, Professor Huxley, to discover a single hermaphrodit animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed that acces from without, and the occasional influence of a distinct individual, can b shown to be physically impossible.
As in the cells of the hive-bee, s here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into th construction of three adjoining cells.
As it cleared the arch, a figure as bright and gay-clad as the boat rose up in it; a slim girl dressed in light blue silk that fluttered in the draughty wind of the bridge.
As it is difficult to imagine that eyes, thoug useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, thei loss may be attributed to disuse.
As it is difficult to show th blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any ancient and nobl family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and almost impossible to d so without this aid, we can understand the extraordinary difficulty whic naturalists have experienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram the various affinities which they perceive between the many living an extinct members of the same great natural class.
As it is extremel common for distinct species belonging to the same genus to inhabit hot an cold countries, if it be true that all the species of the same genus ar descended from a single parent-form, acclimatisation must be readil effected during a long course of descent.
As it seemed, this pleasure-loving people were fond of tent-life, with all its inconveniences, which, indeed, they turned into pleasure also.
As it was, however, she only hazarded a hint, and the hint was lost.
As it was, through a series of acts and words of which we know but few, and a series of thoughts which any one may imagine for himself, she was awakened in four days from the dream of a life.
As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers o land, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would no have ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently  still more formidable barrier, that they would never have extended t distant countries.
As long a the case remained unique no answer could be given.
As long as the condition of life remain the same, we have reason to believe that a modification which has already been inherited for many generations, may continue to b inherited for an almost infinite number of generations.
As man can produce a grea result with his domestic animals and plants by adding up in any give direction individual differences, so could natural selection, but far mor easily from having incomparably longer time for action.
As man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by hi methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not natura selection effect?  Man can act only on external and visible characters: Nature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation o survival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so far a they are useful to any being.
As many creatures, besides birds, are affected by the approach of rain of wind, such indications should not be slighted by the observer of weather.
As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibl survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle fo existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in an manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varyin conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus b NATURALLY SELECTED. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selecte variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.
As modifications of corporeal structure arise from, an are increased by, use or habit, and are diminished or lost by disuse, so  do not doubt it has been with instincts.
As natural selection acts by competition, it adapts and improves th inhabitants of each country only in relation to their co-inhabitants; s that we need feel no surprise at the species of any one country, althoug on the ordinary view supposed to have been created and specially adapte for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the naturalise productions from another land.
As natural selection acts by life and death, by the survival of th fittest, and by the destruction of the less well-fitted individuals, I hav sometimes felt great difficulty in understanding the origin or formation o parts of little importance; almost as great, though of a very differen kind, as in the case of the most perfect and complex organs.
As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modification of structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under it conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduate succession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards th present perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitor of the hive-bee?  I think the answer is not difficult:  cells constructe like those of the bee or the wasp gain in strength, and save much in labou and space, and in the materials of which they are constructed.
As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modifications; i can act only by short and slow steps.
As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitabl modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to tak the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent-for and other less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition.
As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour had reached her, it was impossible for her to understand much of this strange letter.
As nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price, or the good offices of Rebecca, everything was rationally and duly accomplished, and the girls were ready for the morrow.
As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration of  marine fauna, which, during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar Circle, wil account, on the theory of modification, for many closely allied forms no living in marine areas completely sundered.
As on the other hand, therefore, we have ceased to be commercial in our love-matters, so also we have ceased to be artificially foolish.
As organs in this condition would formerly, when stil less developed, have been of even less use than at present, they canno formerly have been produced through variation and natural selection, whic acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications.
As several of the reasons which hav led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, I wil here briefly give them.
As she entered, her own name caught her ear.
As she leant on the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden change which Edmund's kindness had then occasioned, made her hardly know how to support herself.
As she now sat looking at Betsey, she could not but think particularly of another sister, a very pretty little girl, whom she had left there not much younger when she went into Northamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards.
As she opened, and saw its length, she prepared herself for a minute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards the fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate.
As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday; it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage, and found Edmund in the East room.
As showing ho diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed at som little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.
As showing how few the higher groups are in number, and ho widely they are spread throughout the world, the fact is striking that th discovery of Australia has not added an insect belonging to a new class and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from Dr. Hooker, it has adde only two or three families of small size.
As som rude resemblance is necessary for the first start, we can understand how i is that the larger and higher animals do not (with the exception, as far a I know, of one fish) resemble for the sake of protection special objects but only the surface which commonly surrounds them, and this chiefly i colour.
As some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and th inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of natura selection, as many instances as possible ought to be given; but want o space prevents me.
As some few of the old and intermediate forms havin transmitted to the present day descendants but little modified, thes constitute our so-called osculant or aberrant groups.
As some few of the old inhabitant become modified the mutual relations of others will often be disturbed; an this will create new places, ready to be filled up by better adapted forms but all this will take place very slowly.
As soon a the three Orchidean forms, Monachanthus, Myanthus, and Catasetum, which ha previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be sometime produced on the same plant, they were immediately considered as varieties and now I have been able to show that they are the male, female, an hermaphrodite forms of the same species.
As soon as I could speak, I replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to make me suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence.
As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to relate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny's charms.
As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress.
As soon as the female bee deposits her eggs on the surface of th honey stored in the cells, the larvae of the Sitaris leap on the eggs an devour them.
As soon as the lower part of a ste strikes against any object and is stopped, the upper part still goes o bending and revolving, and thus necessarily twines round and up th support.
As soon as the points of value are once acknowledged, th principle, as I have called it, of unconscious selection will alway tend - perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises o falls in fashion - perhaps more in one district than in another, accordin to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants - slowly to add to th characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be.
As soon, however, as gardeners picke out individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, an raised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings an bred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species) thos many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have appeare during the last half-century.
As species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and stil existing causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation; and as the mos important of all causes of organic change is one which is almos independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions namely, the mutual relation of organism to organism - the improvement of on organism entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; i follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutiv formations probably serves as a fair measure of the relative, though no actual lapse of time.
As species belonging to distinct classes have often been adapted b successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstance  - to inhabit, for instance, the three elements of land, air and water - w can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometime been observed between the subgroups of distinct classes.
As species have generally diverged in character during their lon course of descent and modification, we can understand why it is that th more ancient forms, or early progenitors of each group, so often occupy  position in some degree intermediate between existing groups.
As th amount of modification which animals of all kinds undergo partly depends o the lapse of time, and as the islands which are separated from each other or from the mainland, by shallow channels, are more likely to have bee continuously united within a recent period than the islands separated b deeper channels, we can understand how it is that a relation exists betwee the depth of the sea separating two mammalian faunas, and the degree o their affinity, a relation which is quite inexplicable on the theory o independent acts of creation.
As the accumulation of each formation ha often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened betwee successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as I attempted t show in the last chapter, in any one or in any two formations, all th intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at th commencement and close of these periods:  but we ought to find afte intervals, very long as measured by years, but only moderately long a measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as they have been calle by some authors, representative species; and these assuredly we do find.
As the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards backward to th north, in unison with the changing climate, they will not have been expose during their long migrations to any great diversity of temperature; and a they all migrated in a body together, their mutual relations will not hav been much disturbed.
As the capacity o one plant to be grafted or budded on another is unimportant for thei welfare in a state of nature, I presume that no one will suppose that thi capacity is a SPECIALLY endowed quality, but will admit that it i incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants.
As the chelae of Crustaceans resemble in some degree the avicularia o Polyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth while to show that wit the former a long series of serviceable gradations still exists.
As the child beheld his brother's angel in her arms, he cried, 'O, sister, I am here! Take me!' And she turned and smiled upon him, and the star was shining.
As the cold became more and more intense, we kno that Arctic forms invaded the temperate regions; and from the facts jus given, there can hardly be a doubt that some of the more vigorous, dominan and widest-spreading temperate forms invaded the equatorial lowlands.
As the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became fitted for th inhabitants of the north, these would take the places of the forme inhabitants of the temperate regions.
As the degree of sterility in th latter case depends in an eminent degree on the conditions of life bein more or less favourable, so I have found it with illegitimate unions.
As the differences became greater the inferior animals with intermediate characters, being neither very swif nor very strong, would not have been used for breeding, and will thus hav tended to disappear.
As the differences depend o the insects having long fed on distinct plants, it cannot be expected tha intermediate links connecting the several forms should now be found.
As the embryo often shows u more or less plainly the structure of the less modified and ancien progenitor of the group, we can see why ancient and extinct forms so ofte resemble in their adult state the embryos of existing species of the sam class.
As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of Edmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny's use; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have been excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas's return in September, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and without any near prospect of finishing his business.
As the hours passed, and generation succeeded to generation, faith was perceived to have been shaken.
As the individuals of the sam species come in all respects into the closest competition with each other the struggle will generally be most severe between them; it will be almos equally severe between the varieties of the same species, and next i severity between the species of the same genus.
As the instrument is delicate, great care should be taken, in carrying or handling, to keep the top always upwards, and to exclude casual ray of the sun, or a fire, or lamp.
As the larger ground-feeding birds seldom take fligh except to escape danger, it is probable that the nearly wingless conditio of several birds, now inhabiting or which lately inhabited several oceani islands, tenanted by no beasts of prey, has been caused by disuse.
As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.
As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking parallelis in the laws of life throughout time and space; the laws governing th succession of forms in past times being nearly the same with thos governing at the present time the differences in different areas.
As the mercurial column rises with increase of pressure by the atmosphere, and descends when the pressure diminishes, it indicates  greater or less accumulation of air, which, like other fluid, such as water (when heaped above its average level or reduced below it, from whatever cause), will have a tendency to fall or rise till the general equilibrium is restored.
As the mistletoe i disseminated by birds, its existence depends on them; and it ma metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, i tempting the birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds.
As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the large genera, tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which the belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to sprea widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature.
As the moment approached, every telescope in the bottle was directed on the eastern window or the clock; and after the event had taken place, and while the calculations were being prepared, crowds waited at the doors of astronomers, some in prayer, some irreverently betting on the result.
As the motion of the ship at sea causes the mercury to pass more rapidly through the contracted tube the readings are almost the same there as they would be if the tube were not contracted, and in no case do they differ enough to be of importance in maritime use.
As the plants and animal migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one great regio with the native American productions, and would have had to compete wit them; and in the other great region, with those of the Old World.
As the species of the same genus usually have, though by no mean invariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always i structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between them, if the come into competition with each other, than between the species of distinc genera.
As the subject is somewhat complex,  must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter.
As the tide leaves its drif in horizontal lines, rising higher on the shores where the tide rise highest, so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountai summits, in a line gently rising from the Arctic lowlands to a grea latitude under the equator.
As the two beautiful young faces bent over the rudder, they seemed to me to be very close together, and though it only lasted a moment, a sort of pang shot through me as I looked on.
As the variability of each species i an independent property, and will be taken advantage of by natura selection, only so far as it profits each individual in its comple struggle for life, so the amount of modification in different species wil be no uniform quantity.
As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward, closel followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperat regions.
As the wind had set fo several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could not thu have been carried.
As thes points of affinity are believed to be real and not merely adaptive, the must be due in accordance with our view to inheritance from a commo progenitor.
As these are formed, the species of the less vigorous groups, fro their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor, tend to becom extinct together, and to leave no modified offspring on the face of th earth.
As these were the best of her hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of a long morning, spent principally with her two aunts, she was often under the influence of much less sanguine views.
As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.
As they went down into the valley of the Thyme, the babble of the stream rose into the air like a perennial laughter.
As they were the first of the sex I had seen on this eventful morning, I naturally looked at them very attentively, and found them at least as good as the gardens, the architecture, and the male men.
As this Helix has a thick calcareous operculum  removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I again immerse it for fourteen days in sea-water, and again it recovered and crawled away.
As this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to th reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.
As to 'the rebels,' I have told you that the outbreak of actual war made them careless of trying to save the wretched scraps of wealth that they had.
As to Dick, it was quite right to let him pull, for he was as strong as a horse, and had the greatest delight in bodily exercise, whatever it was.
As to Edmund, we must learn to do without him.
As to Mr. Crawford, she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own disposition, convince him that he was not capable of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world, and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself.
As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that score; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain, her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram.
As to her cousins' gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them, especially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same, and listened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them.
As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term.
As to his ever making anything tolerable of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that except his mother; she, indeed, regretted that his part was not more considerable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes; but the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword, and the first line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter through the rest.
As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again.
As to our dinner, we are going to have our feast in the church.
As to the crafts, throwing the clay must be jolly work: the glass-blowing is rather a sweltering job; but some folk like it very much indeed; and I don't much wonder: there is such a sense of power, when you have got deft in it, in dealing with the hot metal.
As to the land being a garden, I have heard that they used to have shrubberies and rockeries in gardens once; and though I might not like the artificial ones, I assure you that some of the natural rockeries of our garden are worth seeing.
As to the market, this is not one of our busy days; so we shall do better with it another time, because you will see more people.
As to the women themselves, it was pleasant indeed to see them, they were so kind and happy-looking in expression of face, so shapely and well-knit of body, and thoroughly healthy-looking and strong.
As to their dress, which of course I took note of, I should say that they were decently veiled with drapery, and not bundled up with millinery; that they were clothed like women, not upholstered like armchairs, as most women of our time are.
As to this, as at our breakfast, everything was cooked and served with a daintiness which showed that those who had prepared it were interested in it; but there was no excess either of quantity or of gourmandise; everything was simple, though so excellent of its kind; and it was made clear to us that this was no feast, only an ordinary meal.
As to those who had been poor, all through the war, which lasted about two years, their condition had been bettering, in spite of the struggle; and when peace came at last, in a very short time they made great strides towards a decent life.
As to writing, we do not encourage them to scrawl too early (though scrawl a little they will), because it gets them into a habit of ugly writing; and what's the use of a lot of ugly writing being done, when rough printing can be done so easily.
As to your brother's behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a particularity: I had been sensible of it some little time, perhaps two or three weeks; but then I considered it as meaning nothing: I put it down as simply being his way, and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me.
As twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms th basis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants acquire thi power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved and increase through natural selection.
As w here and there see a thin, straggling branch springing from a fork low dow in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive o its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus o Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities tw large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fata competition by having inhabited a protected station.
As we find organs o high physiological importance - those which serve to preserve life under th most diverse conditions of existence - are generally the most constant, w attach especial value to them; but if these same organs, in another grou or section of a group, are found to differ much, we at once value them les in our classification.
As we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the Pigeon are descende from a single wild species, I compared the young pigeons within twelv hours after being hatched.
As we have no writte pedigrees, we are forced to trace community of descent by resemblances o any kind.
As we have reason to believe that large areas ar affected by the same movement, it is probable that strictly contemporaneou formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the sam quarter of the world; but we are very far from having any right to conclud that this has invariably been the case, and that large areas hav invariably been affected by the same movements.
As we have seen in the last chapter that some forms hav retained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geologica period, so certain species have migrated over vast spaces, and have no become greatly or at all modified.
As we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen b uncivilised man because they were useful, and because they bred readil under confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable o far-extended transportation, the common and extraordinary capacity in ou domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different climates, bu of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test) under them, may be used a an argument that a large proportion of other animals now in a state o nature could easily be brought to bear widely different climates.
As we possess only the last volume of the geologica record, and that in a very broken condition, we have no right to expect except in rare cases, to fill up the wide intervals in the natural system and thus to unite distinct families or orders.
As we see that those variations which, under domestication, appear at an particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the sam period; for instance, in the shape, size and flavour of the seeds of th many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the caterpilla and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in the horns of our shee and cattle when nearly adult; so in a state of nature natural selectio will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age, by th accumulation of variations profitable at that age, and by their inheritanc at a corresponding age.
As we sometimes see individuals following habits different from thos proper to their species and to the other species of the same genus, w might expect that such individuals would occasionally give rise to ne species, having anomalous habits, and with their structure either slightl or considerably modified from that of their type.
As we went down to the boat next morning, Walter could not quite keep off the subject of last night, though he was more hopeful than he had been then, and seemed to think that if the unlucky homicide could not be got to go over-sea, he might at any rate go and live somewhere in the neighbourhood pretty much by himself; at any rate, that was what he himself had proposed.
As we went higher up the river, there was less difference between the Thames of that day and Thames as I remembered it; for setting aside the hideous vulgarity of the cockney villas of the well-to-do, stockbrokers and other such, which in older time marred the beauty of the bough-hung banks, even this beginning of the country Thames was always beautiful; and as we slipped between the lovely summer greenery, I almost felt my youth come back to me, and as if I were on one of those water excursions which I used to enjoy so much in days when I was too happy to think that there could be much amiss anywhere.
As we went, I could not help putting beside his promised picture of the hay-field as it was then the picture of it as I remembered it, and especially the images of the women engaged in the work rose up before me: the row of gaunt figures, lean, flat-breasted, ugly, without a grace of form or face about them; dressed in wretched skimpy print gowns, and hideous flapping sun-bonnets, moving their rakes in a listless mechanical way.
As we went, the folk on the bank talked indeed, mingling their kind voices with the cuckoo's song, the sweet strong whistle of the blackbirds, and the ceaseless note of the corn-crake as he crept through the long grass of the mowing-field; whence came waves of fragrance from the flowering clover amidst of the ripe grass.
As well as I can recollect, it was always much the same.
As why should he not if he likes? only we are his special friends, you know, so of course we jest with him.
As with birds the individuals of the same species, inhabiting the sam country, vary extremely little, I have particularly attended to them; an the rule certainly seems to hold good in this class.
As with mariners shipwrecked near a coast, i would have been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swi still further, whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers i they had not been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck.
As with the varieties of the stock, so with socia insects, selection has been applied to the family, and not to th individual, for the sake of gaining a serviceable end.
As yet I have not found a single terrestrial animal which ca fertilise itself.
As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford's behaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second rubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play, he became a looker-on at the other, he found his niece the object of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed character.
As, however, we do not know the commo ancestor of any natural group, we cannot distinguish between reversionar and analogous characters.
Ask as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattl might not have descended from Long-horns, or both from a common parent stock, and he will laugh you to scorn.
Ask your uncle what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and though they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time.
Assuming that an insect originally happened to resemble in som degree a dead twig or a decayed leaf, and that it varied slightly in man ways, then all the variations which rendered the insect at all more lik any such object, and thus favoured its escape, would be preserved, whil other variations would be neglected and ultimately lost; or, if the rendered the insect at all less like the imitated object, they would b eliminated.
Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life! The kind hand trembled.
Assuredly the being able to reach, a each stage of increased size, to a supply of food, left untouched by th other hoofed quadrupeds of the country, would have been of some advantag to the nascent giraffe.
Assuredly we shall never succeed i making so perfect a collection:  nevertheless, in certain classes, we ar tending toward this end; and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an abl paper, on the high importance of looking to types, whether or not we ca separate and define the groups to which such types belong.
At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it.
At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his visits, at present or in future.
At Mansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts, no tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular course of cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance; everybody's feelings were consulted.
At a distance of some five or six feet from the air-tigh chamber a vertical scale is fixed.
At a distance, unassailed by his looks or his kindness, and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence, she should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she should be able to think of him as in London, and arranging everything there, without wretchedness.
At about the week's end from his return to Mansfield, Tom's immediate danger was over, and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his mother perfectly easy; for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering, helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never thinking beyond what she heard, with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint, Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medical imposition.
At an ancient epoch the highest an lowest molluscoidal animals, namely, cephalopods and brachiopods, swarme in numbers; at the present time both groups are greatly reduced, whil others, intermediate in organisation, have largely increased; consequentl some naturalists maintain that molluscs were formerly more highly develope than at present; but a stronger case can be made out on the opposite side by considering the vast reduction of brachiopods, and the fact that ou existing cephalopods, though few in number, are more highly organised tha their ancient representatives.
At another, she suspected him of jealousy against her father; and for that, although she could see excuses for it, she yet despised him.
At any other time this would have been felt dreadfully.
At dinner we fell in with an old, but very bright and intelligent man, who seemed in a country way to be another edition of old Hammond.
At each period of growth all the growing twigs have trie to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twig and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have a all times overmastered other species in the great battle for life.
At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp.
At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not small, at a foot's pace; then, at her apparent suggestion, they rose into a canter; and to Fanny's timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat.
At first he scarcely said anything; his looks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked to the gate and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.
At first nothing would content them but we must go with them into the hay-field, and breakfast with them; but Dick put forward his theory of beginning the hay-harvest higher up the water, and not spoiling my pleasure therein by giving me a taste of it elsewhere, and they gave way, though unwillingly.
At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H.C. Watson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance o this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as di subsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger terms.
At first, it was a sort of stupefaction; but every moment was quickening her perception of the horrible evil.
At last as we were passing through a reach of the river where on the side of the towing-path was a highish bank with a thick whispering bed of reeds before it, and on the other side a higher bank, clothed with willows that dipped into the stream and crowned by ancient elm-trees, we saw bright figures coming along close to the bank, as if they were looking for something; as, indeed, they were, and we - that is, Dick and his company - were what they were looking for.
At last came a great crash.
At last it was agreed that they should endeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little more about it.
At last the base of th cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and these remaining fixed have to be worn away atom by atom, until after being reduced in size the can be rolled about by the waves, and then they are more quickly groun into pebbles, sand, or mud.
At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up.
At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said.
At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out �I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is! �What is it?� cried Fred.
At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other; and when again alone and able to recall the whole, she was inclined to believe their performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself.
At last the trotting of a horse sounded in the distance, the park gates opened with a clang, and then Mr. Naseby appeared, with stooping shoulders and a heavy, bilious countenance, languidly rising to the trot.
At last we came to a reach of the river where on the left hand a very pretty little village with some old houses in it came down to the edge of the water, over which was a ferry; and beyond these houses the elm-beset meadows ended in a fringe of tall willows, while on the right hand went the tow-path and a clear space before a row of trees, which rose up behind huge and ancient, the ornaments of a great park: but these drew back still further from the river at the end of the reach to make way for a little town of quaint and pretty houses, some new, some old, dominated by the long walls and sharp gables of a great red-brick pile of building, partly of the latest Gothic, partly of the court-style of Dutch William, but so blended together by the bright sun and beautiful surroundings, including the bright blue river, which it looked down upon, that even amidst the beautiful buildings of that new happy time it had a strange charm about it.
At last we passed under another ancient bridge; and through meadows bordered at first with huge elm-trees mingled with sweet chestnut of younger but very elegant growth; and the meadows widened out so much that it seemed as if the trees must now be on the bents only, or about the houses, except for the growth of willows on the immediate banks; so that the wide stretch of grass was little broken here.
At last, after various attempts at meeting, I have seen your cousins, 'dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth'; they found me at home yesterday, and we were glad to see each other again.
At last, however, he began to think - as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too - at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.
At least, I suppose not.
At length it broke upon his listening ear.
At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived.
At length the long-expected knock was heard.
At length there was a pause.
At length, a something like composure succeeded.
At long intervals of time, out of millions o individuals reared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food deviations of structure so strongly pronounced as to deserve to be calle monstrosities arise; but monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinc line from slighter variations.
At my request Sir C. Lyell wrot to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on thes islands, and he answered that he had found large fragments of granite an other rocks, which do not occur in the archipelago.
At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their ol cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, an likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax.
At one moment she simply resented the selfishness of a man who had obtruded his dark looks and passionate language on her joy; for there is nothing that a woman can less easily forgive than the language of a passion which, even if only for the moment, she does not share.
At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.
At one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that th sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly acquire through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of fertility which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared in certai individuals of one variety when crossed with those of another variety.
At present it has the great interest of still preserving a great mass of pre-commercial building, and is a very beautiful place, yet there are many towns which have become scarcely less beautiful.
At sea, barometers of this construction cannot be used.
At such a moment to give way to gaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty.
At such times an eye on an overlooking height may see an extended body of vapour below; which the cooling of night has rendered visible.
At th other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in  double layer:  each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with th basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join an inverted pyramid, o three rhombs.
At the Cape of Good Hope a very few Europea species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the mountain several representative European forms are found which have not bee discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa.
At the White House, matters must be better looked after.
At the commencement of m observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticate animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making ou this obscure problem.
At the end of the nineteenth century the cry arose for compelling the masters to employ their men a less number of hours in the day: this cry gathered volume quickly, and the masters had to yield to it.
At the furthest corner of the room, at a desk near the window, sat a little old man in a roomy oak chair, well becushioned.
At the moment she could only thank and accept.

At this rat there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as man sheep, and several goats, in Europe alone, and several even within Grea Britain.
At this very moment he is wild to see you, and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so, and for making his pleasure conduce to yours.
At this, th newer Pliocene period, the majority of the inhabitants of the world wer specifically the same as now, and we have good reason to believe that th climate was warmer than at the present day.
Attention became early rivetted upon the clock; the evidences of purpose in creation centred there; the creator, who spoke obscurely in his other works, seemed in the clock to utter an authentic voice; and theism and atheism joined battle on the question of the Clockmaker.
Audubo has given several remarkable cases of differences in the nests of the sam species in the northern and southern United States.
Aug.
Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people as you.
Authors have insisted on the necessity of arrangin varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system; we are cautioned for instance, not to class two varieties of the pine-apple together, merel because their fruit, though the most important part, happens to be nearl identical; no one puts the Swedish and common turnip together, though th esculent and thickened stems are so similar.
Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the vie that each species has been independently created.
Authors sometimes argue in a circl when they state that important organs never vary; for these same author practically rank those parts as important (as some few naturalists hav honestly confessed) which do not vary; and, under this point of view, n instance will ever be found of an important part varying; but under an other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.
Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One.
Backing is a bad sign, with any wind.
Bands of young men, like the marauders in the great strike of whom I told you just now, armed themselves and drilled, and began on any opportunity or pretence to skirmish with the people in the streets.
Baron Aucapitaine has since tried similar experiments.
Barrande, also shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successiv Silurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds  surprising amount of difference in the species.
Bath seems full, and everything as usual.
Bats have been seen wandering by day far over the Atlanti Ocean; and two North American species, either regularly or occasionally visit Bermuda, at the distance of 600 miles from the mainland.
Bats, a formerly shown, probably acquired their wings by at first gliding throug the air from tree to tree, like the so-called flying squirrels, for th sake of escaping from their enemies, or for avoiding falls; but when th power of true flight had once been acquired, it would never be reconverte back, at least for the above purposes, into the less efficient power o gliding through the air.
Bats, might, indeed, like many birds, have ha their wings greatly reduced in size, or completely lost, through disuse but in this case it would be necessary that they should first have acquire the power of running quickly on the ground, by the aid of their hind leg alone, so as to compete with birds or other ground animals; and for such  change a bat seems singularly ill-fitted.
Battle withi battle must be continually recurring with varying success; and yet in th long-run the forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remain for long periods of time uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle woul give the victory to one organic being over another.
Be assured he cares for nobody but you.
Be here all the earlier next morning.
Be honest and poor, by all means - but I shall not envy you; I do not much think I shall even respect you.
Bearing in mind that the mutual relation o organism to organism is of the highest importance, we can see why tw areas, having nearly the same physical conditions, should often b inhabited by very different forms of life; for according to the length o time which has elapsed since the colonists entered one of the regions, o both; according to the nature of the communication which allowed certai forms and not others to enter, either in greater or lesser numbers according or not as those which entered happened to come into more or les direct competition with each other and with the aborigines; and accordin as the immigrants were capable of varying more or less rapidly, there woul ensue in the to or more regions, independently of their physica conditions, infinitely diversified conditions of life; there would be a almost endless amount of organic action and reaction, and we should fin some groups of beings greatly, and some only slightly modified; som developed in great force, some existing in scanty numbers - and this we d find in the several great geographical provinces of the world.
Bearing such facts in mind, it may b believed that under certain circumstances individual differences in th curvature or length of the proboscis, etc., too slight to be appreciated b us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that certain individuals woul be able to obtain their food more quickly than others; and thus th communities to which they belonged would flourish and throw off many swarm inheriting the same peculiarities.
Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.
Bees visit these flowers, like those of the Coryanthes in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch a long tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have called it, the antenna.
Befor coming to Mr. Mivart's objections, it may be well to explain once again ho natural selection will act in all ordinary cases.
Before and during the earlier part of serene and settled weather, the mercury commonly stands high, and in stationary.
Before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organi beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these latte are subject to any variation.
Before entering on the subject of this chapter I must make a fe preliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on natura selection.
Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in.
Before ma inhabited India or Africa, some cause must have checked the continue increase of the existing elephant.
Before me, the elm-boughs still hid most of what houses there might be in this river-side dwelling of men; but to the right of the cart-road a few grey buildings of the simplest kind showed here and there.
Before that period, as I understand, the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth; but this is not quite certain.
Before the last grea Glacial period, no doubt the intertropical mountains were stocked wit endemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere yielded to the mor dominant forms generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshop of the north.
Before the phaeton had driven off, the girl had entered the station and seated herself upon a bench.
Before the week ended, it was all disappointment.
Before we parted from these girls we saw two sturdy young men and a woman putting off from the Berkshire shore, and then Dick bethought him of a little banter of the girls, and asked them how it was that there was nobody of the male kind to go with them across the water, and where their boats were gone to.
Begin at the beginning, and tell me all you have seen of him, all he said and all you answered.
Being accustomed to the barometer on our coast, one could tell from what quarter the wind would probably come by the height of the barometer, taken in connexion with its previous height, and the state of the weather and the strength of winds that had prevailed before.
Being descended from  form that stood between the parent-species (A) and (I), now supposed to b extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in characte between the two groups descended from these two species.
Being now in her twenty-first year, Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father's, as well as ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime object, it became, by the same rule of moral obligation, her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could.

Believe me, they are not only natural, they are philanthropic and virtuous.
Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, afte deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons.
Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have lon remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to grea oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the above view, an to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period, such as th older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and animal inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these plants an animals, both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate southward as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement of th Glacial period.
Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head.
Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies a about the same distance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do fro South America, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess  single endemic land bird; and we know from Mr. J.M. Jones's admirabl account of Bermuda, that very many North American birds occasionally o even frequently visit this island.
Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet's family.
Beside them lay a good big basket that had hints about it of cold pie and wine: a half dozen of young women stood by watching the work or the workers, both of which were worth watching, for the latter smote great strokes and were very deft in their labour, and as handsome clean-built fellows as you might find a dozen of in a summer day.
Beside thes inherent difficulties in deciding which forms are the most advanced i organisation, we ought not solely to compare the highest members of a clas at any two periods - though undoubtedly this is one and perhaps the mos important element in striking a balance - but we ought to compare all th members, high and low, at two periods.
Besides - excuse me - I don't know that.

Besides, I cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, where he would have had less time and obligation -  where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself, the frequency, at least, of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now.
Besides, I shall lose it: I always lose my pipes.
Besides, I want to bring my friend here to the proper place.
Besides, I was using my eyes with all my might, wondering as the old horse jogged on, when I should come into London proper, and what it would be like now.
Besides, as we said before, it is not a bad thing to have some record of what our forefathers thought a handsome building.
Besides, if one person gave me something, then another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won't think me rude if I say that I shouldn't know where to stow away so many mementos of friendship.
Besides, it is such very easy work that anybody can do it.
Besides, it was the right man that was killed and not the wrong.
Besides, perhaps he will be the better able to answer my questions after his own have been answered.
Besides, that would be all recreation and indulgence, without the wholesome alloy of labour, and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness.
Besides, there was gratitude towards her, for having made their tete-a-tete so much less painful than her fears had predicted.
Besides, we are in no hurry: we are not going far above Oxford; and even if we are benighted, we shall have the moon, which will give us nothing worse of a night than a greyer day.
Betsey and I have been watching for you this half-hour.
Betsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her abilities before her fine new sister.
Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet her greatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her pleasure, and then encouraged to report any evil of them, she was almost as ready to despair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan's temper she had many doubts.
Between his self-knowledge, which was considerable, and his vanity, which was immense, he had created a strange hybrid animal, and called it by his own name.
Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room, fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece's ill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner, which were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say no more.
Between the sterility thu superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points of similarity.
Between us, I think we should have won you.
Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.
Beyond that the houses are scattered wide about the meadows there, which are very beautiful, especially when you get on to the lovely river Lea (where old Isaak Walton used to fish, you know) about the places called Stratford and Old Ford, names which of course you will not have heard of, though the Romans were busy there once upon a time.
Beyond thi superficial resemblance, there is hardly any real similarity between th eyes of cuttle-fish and vertebrates, as may be seen by consulting Hensen' admirable memoir on these organs in the Cephalopoda.
Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture natural selection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far a we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising labour and wax.
Birds of this order wander more than those o any other; and are occasionally found on the most remote and barren island of the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the surface of th sea, so that any dirt on their feet would not be washed off; and whe gaining the land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-wate haunts.
Birthright and habit must settle the business.
Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely comprehend to have been possible.
Bivalve shells are made to open and shut, but on wha a number of patterns is the hinge constructed, from the long row of neatl interlocking teeth in a Nucula to the simple ligament of a Mussel!  Seed are disseminated by their minuteness, by their capsule being converted int a light balloon-like envelope, by being embedded in pulp or flesh, forme of the most diverse parts, and rendered nutritious, as well a conspicuously coloured, so as to attract and be devoured by birds, b having hooks and grapnels of many kinds and serrated awns, so as to adher to the fur of quadrupeds, and by being furnished with wings and plumes, a different in shape as they are elegant in structure, so as to be wafted b every breeze.
Bless those women; they never do anything by halves.
Bless you! He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure.
Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.
Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly.
Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.
Bob said he didn�t believe there ever was such a goose cooked.
Bob�s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.
Boffin, in a fresh suit of clothes, welcomed me back with stately courtesy; the weaver wanted to button-hole me and get out of me what old Hammond had said, but was very friendly and cheerful when Dick warned him off; Annie shook hands with me, and hoped I had had a pleasant day - so kindly, that I felt a slight pang as our hands parted; for to say the truth, I liked her better than Clara, who seemed to be always a little on the defensive, whereas Annie was as frank as could be, and seemed to get honest pleasure from everything and everybody about her without the least effort.
Bot.
Both Gartner and Kolreuter have proved that in genera including numerou species, a series can be formed from species which when crossed yield fewe and fewer seeds, to species which never produce a single seed, but yet ar affected by the pollen of certain other species, for the germen swells.
Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word of accordant praise could be extorted from her; yet both feeling that it could not be.
Both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either pure parent form, b repeated crosses in successive generations with either parent.
Both in Switzerland and England th slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvae, and the masters alon go on slave-making expeditions.
Both in time and spac species and groups of species have their points of maximum development.
Both on this day as well as yesterday we had, as you may think, met and passed and been passed by many craft of one kind and another.
Both shores had a line of very pretty houses, low and not large, standing back a little way from the river; they were mostly built of red brick and roofed with tiles, and looked, above all, comfortable, and as if they were, so to say, alive, and sympathetic with the life of the dwellers in them.
Both single species an whole groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups, as w have seen, have endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the presen day; some have disappeared before the close of the palaeozoic period.
Both these results follow when another division i made, and when all the least genera, with from only one to four species are altogether excluded from the tables.
Both were kissed very tenderly, but Tom she wanted to keep by her, to try to trace the features of the baby she had loved, and talked to, of his infant preference of herself.
Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied b an elongated head.
Breeders habitually speak of an animal's organisation a something plastic, which they can model almost as they please.
Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marble together.
Brehm saw the young of an African monkey (Cercopithecus) clinging to th under surface of their mother by their hands, and at the same time the hooked their little tails round that of their mother.
Briefly, the barometer shows weight or pressure of the air; the thermometer - heat and cold, or temperature; and the wet thermometer compared with a dry one, the degree of moisture or dampness.
Bronn adduces the length of the ears and tails in the differen species of hares and mice - the complex folds of enamel in the teeth of man animals, and a multitude of analogous cases.
Bronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each other i single characters, but in many parts; and he asks, how it always comes tha many parts of the organisation should have been modified at the same tim through variation and natural selection?  But there is no necessity fo supposing that all the parts of any being have been simultaneousl modified.
Bu as all groups cannot thus go on increasing in size, for the world would no hold them, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant.
Bu as we have no facts to guide us, speculation on the subject is almos useless.
Bu characters exclusively due to analogous variation would probably be of a unimportant nature, for the preservation of all functionally importan characters will have been determined through natural selection, i accordance with the different habits of the species.
Bu disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it has com to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for existence and will thus have little power on an organ during early life; hence th organ will not be reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age.
Bu if he confine his attention to one class within one country he will soo make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful forms.
Bu it is a far more important consideration, that during the process o further modification, by which two varieties are supposed to be converte and perfected into two distinct species, the two which exist in large numbers, from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great advantage over th intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow an intermediate zone.
Bu structures thus indirectly gained, although at first of no advantage to  species, may subsequently have been taken advantage of by its modifie descendants, under new conditions of life and newly acquired habits.
Bu these cases are so wonderful that they were introduced as difficulties o objections to our theory.
Bu this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless unde domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the power o flight.
Bu variations which, for all that we can see might have appeared eithe earlier or later in life, likewise tend to reappear at a corresponding ag in the offspring and parent.
Bu webbed feet no doubt were as useful to the progenitor of the upland goos and of the frigate-bird, as they now are to the most aquatic of livin birds.
Bu why, it may be asked, are certain forms treated as the mimicked and other as the mimickers?  Mr. Bates satisfactorily answers this question b showing that the form which is imitated keeps the usual dress of the grou to which it belongs, while the counterfeiters have changed their dress an do not resemble their nearest allies.
Bu with organic beings the case is different, and the view above given accord with their natural arrangement in group under group; and no othe explanation has ever been attempted.
Bud-variations, such as the appearance o a moss-rose on a common rose, or of a nectarine on a peach-tree, offer goo instances of spontaneous variations; but even in these cases, if we bear i mind the power of a minute drop of poison in producing complex galls, w ought not to feel too sure that the above variations are not the effect o some local change in the nature of the sap, due to some change in th conditions.
Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.
Burning as the sun was, there was a fresh feeling in the air that almost set us a-longing for the rest of the hot afternoon, and the stretch of blossoming wheat seen from the shadow of the boughs.
Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough.
But  must pass over this preliminary difficulty.
But Baddeley was stout.
But Dick got rather restive under so much ancient history: besides, I suspect he wanted to keep me as fresh as he could for his great-grandfather.
But Dr. Cruger saw crowds of large humble-bees visiting th gigantic flowers of this orchid, not in order to suck nectar, but to gna off the ridges within the chamber above the bucket; in doing this the frequently pushed each other into the bucket, and their wings being thu wetted they could not fly away, but were compelled to crawl out through th passage formed by the spout or overflow.
But Dr. Gunther has lately shown that the Galaxia attenuatus inhabits Tasmania, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands and th mainland of South America.
But Edmund, delighted with her having such an happiness offered, and ascertaining with half a look, and half a sentence, that she had no objection but on her aunt's account, could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her, and therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should be accepted; and though Fanny would not venture, even on his encouragement, to such a flight of audacious independence, it was soon settled, that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant might expect her.
But Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going down to him, that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it better to indulge her.
But Fanny still hung back.
But I am growing old, I am growing old, I am growing old, and - I regret to add - bald.
But I am interrupting your history of the river: pray go on.
But I am not fishing; don't compliment me.
But I am spoilt, Fanny, for common female society.
But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round - apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that - as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.
But I am well aware that these genera statements, without the facts in detail, can produce but a feeble effect o the reader's mind.
But I believe that the effects o habit are in many cases of subordinate importance to the effects of th natural selection of what may be called spontaneous variations o instincts; - that is of variations produced by the same unknown causes whic produce slight deviations of bodily structure.
But I believe that thei fertility has been diminished in nearly all these cases by an independen cause, namely, by too close interbreeding.
But I can find out no such case.
But I cannot call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and eternally, which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and consequently of the manners which result from their influence.
But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you, and come to a decision.
But I could show that none of these characters are universal.
But I dare say you know exactly -  I always imagine you are - perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all - or not at present.
But I daresay in the country which you come from, you would think this petty and unadventurous, and would think the worse of me for it.
But I do believe that natural selection will generally ac very slowly, only at long intervals of time, and only on a few of th inhabitants of the same region.
But I do not believ that it will ever be proved that within the recent period most of ou continents which now stand quite separate, have been continuously, o almost continuously united with each other, and with the many existin oceanic islands.
But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves woul float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in ou experiments.
But I do not pretend that I should ever have suspected how poo was the record in the best preserved geological sections, had not th absence of innumerable transitional links between the species which live at the commencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on m theory.
But I do say that there is no unvarying conventional set of rules by which people are judged; no bed of Procrustes to stretch or cramp their minds and lives; no hypocritical excommunication which people are forced to pronounce, either by unconsidered habit, or by the unexpressed threat of the lesser interdict if they are lax in their hypocrisy.
But I fear - In short, I have been told that political strife was a necessary result of human nature.
But I fear, darling, we may have long to wait, and shall want all our courage.
But I hardly expected to hear you speak so.
But I hav already remarked that it is doubtful whether New Zealand and New Caledoni ought to be classed as oceanic islands; and this is still more doubtfu with respect to the Andaman and Solomon groups and the Seychelles.
But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.
But I have no space here to enlarge on the many ways by which animals endeavour t frighten away their enemies.
But I have not seen the place now for many years, except once, when we Leaguers went a pleasuring to High Beech.
But I have not the least inclination to go near her.
But I have not the power, Spirit.
But I have very little doubt it will be.
But I hear from Professor Wyman, who has made numerous carefu measurements, that the accuracy of the workmanship of the bee has bee greatly exaggerated; so much so, that whatever the typical form of the cel may be, it is rarely, if ever, realised.
But I left no stone unturned.
But I may here state that, looking to the domestic dogs of th whole world, I have, after a laborious collection of all known facts, com to the conclusion that several wild species of Canidae have been tamed, an that their blood, in some cases mingled together, flows in the veins of ou domestic breeds.
But I must admit that they were mostly prigs, and that they were commercial.
But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument.
But I must confess, that, with all my faith in natura selection, I should never have anticipated that this principle could hav been efficient in so high a degree, had not the case of these neute insects led me to this conclusion.
But I must explain my meaning more fully.
But I must get down here, neighbours; I have got to call on a friend who lives in the gardens behind this Long Acre.
But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes o so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself mad somewhat irregular, nor that it goes on continuously; it is far mor probable that each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then agai undergoes modification.
But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I cannot but be surprised that such an elegant lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table, too, which fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their senses would have done, instead of having that absurd new one of his own, which is wider, literally wider than the dinner-table here, how infinitely better it would have been! and how much more he would have been respected! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere.
But I must tell you another thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid.
But I must tell you that in point of fact the minority very seldom enforces this rule, but generally yields in a friendly manner.
But I say flatly that in spite of all their cleverness and vigour, and capacity for story-telling, there is something loathsome about them.
But I shall hav to return in a future chapter to the preservation and perpetuation o single or occasional variations.
But I should have had no guess as to where I was, if I had not started from the waterside; for King Street was gone, and the highway ran through wide sunny meadows and garden-like tillage.
But I should like to ask a few more questions, and then I have done for to-day.
But I think her present home must do her good.
But I think it can be in large part explained.
But I think it would be better so.
But I think sometimes people are too careless of the history of the past - too apt to leave it in the hands of old learned men like Hammond.
But I think we have improved it.
But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind; and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.
But I told a man mending a hedge that it was Thornton Lacey, and he agreed to it.
But I want to return to the position of women amongst you.
But I will pass over this way of escaping fro the difficulty; for I believe that many perfectly defined species have bee formed on strictly continuous areas; though I do not doubt that th formerly broken condition of areas now continuous, has played an importan part in the formation of new species, more especially with freely-crossin and wandering animals.
But I will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure, if you will tell me what about.
But I'll offer to go, if anybody else will.
But Miss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much affectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the cross, and the ball, and herself, as to be finally successful.
But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her family, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly.
But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram, I dare say, would take their chance.
But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be very well spared - she being ready to give up all her own time to her as requested -  and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.
But Mrs. Rushworth's day of good looks will come; we have cards for her first party on the 28th.
But Natural Selection, we shall hereafter see, is a powe incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man' feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.
But Scrooge was all the worse for this.
But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how.
But Sir Charles Lyell now gives the support o his high authority to the opposite side, and most geologists an palaeontologists are much shaken in their former belief.
But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to-morrow, and says we must consider his journey.
But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of children, feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by with a flower in her hat.
But Tom's extravagance had, previous to that event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder.
But a hooked see might be carried to an island by other means; and the plant then becomin modified would form an endemic species, still retaining its hooks, whic would form a useless appendage, like the shrivelled wings under th soldered wing-covers of many insular beetles.
But a hybri partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother; it ma therefore, before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother' womb, or within the egg or seed produced by the mother, be exposed t conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to peris at an early period; more especially as all very young beings are eminentl sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life.
But a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent.
But a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like th wing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, i the part be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has bee inherited for a very long period; for in this case it will have bee rendered constant by long-continued natural selection.
But a plant on th edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, thoug more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture.
But a still mor important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of ever living creature is due to inheritance; and consequently, though each bein assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures have no no very close and direct relation to present habits of life.
But a the original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly at th extreme end of the original genus, the six descendants from (I) will, owin to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight descendants fro (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have gone on diverging i different directions.
But according to the view that all the species of a genus though distributed to the most remote points of the world, are descende from a single progenitor, we ought to find, and I believe as a general rul we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely.
But after all, th cause more probably lies in some imperfection in the original act o impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly developed, rather tha in the conditions to which it is subsequently exposed.
But after very long interval of time, and after great geographical changes, permitting muc intermigration, the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms, an there will be nothing immutable in the distribution of organic beings.
But again, think if the destruction or serious injury of a man momentarily overcome by wrath or folly can be any atonement to the commonwealth? Surely it can only be an additional injury to it.
But against the belief i such abrupt changes, embryology enters a strong protest.
But al geologists, excepting the few who believe that our present metamorphi schists and plutonic rocks once formed the primordial nucleus of the globe will admit that these latter rocks have been stripped of their covering t an enormous extent.
But alas! the squire was sick and peevish; he had been all day glooming over Dick's estrangement - for so he put it to himself, and now with growls, cold words, and the cold shoulder, he beat off all advances, and entrenched himself in a just resentment.
But alas, that very evening destroyed it all.
But already Grimm ha shown that another fly, a Chironomus, reproduces itself in nearly the sam manner, and he believes that this occurs frequently in the order.
But also it is clear that it won't do to overdose you with information about this place, and that you had best suck it in little by little.
But analogy ma be a deceitful guide.
But another agency is perhaps mor effectual:  I suspended the feet of a duck in an aquarium, where many ov of fresh-water shells were hatching; and I found that numbers of th extremely minute and just-hatched shells crawled on the feet, and clung t them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarre off, though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily dro off.
But another curious thing happened: a band of young men of the upper classes armed themselves, and coolly went marauding in the streets, taking what suited them of such eatables and portables that they came across in the shops which had ventured to open.
But any morning will do for this.
But are you so insensible as you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not.
But as I conclude that she must wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence.
But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart.
But as a general rule, the mor diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can b rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the mor their modified progeny will increase.
But as ants which are not slave-makers, will, as I have seen carry off pupae of other species, if scattered near their nests, it i possible that such pupae originally stored as food might become developed and the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow thei proper instincts, and do what work they could.
But as he proceeded in his story, these fears were over.
But as his opinions fluctuated greatly a different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of th transformation of species, I need not here enter on details.
But as it is - I must speak plainly - what you propose is degrading to you, and an insult to me, and a rank unkindness to your father.
But as it was, they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection, and with some very precious sensations on hers.
But as it was, things soon righted themselves.
But as it would not indicate the quarter from which it was coming, would you have the merchant ship always remain in port till the barometer showed fine weather?
But as long as selection i rapidly going on, much variability in the parts undergoing modification ma always be expected.
But as species are more variable when domesticated or cultivated than unde their natural conditions, it is not probable that such great and abrup variations have often occurred under nature, as are known occasionally t arise under domestication.
But as such were Fanny's persuasions, she suffered very much from them, and could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.
But as the excretion is extremel viscid, it is no doubt a convenience to the aphides to have it removed therefore probably they do not excrete solely for the good of the ants.
But as the variability of the extraordinarily developed par or organ has been so great and long-continued within a period no excessively remote, we might, as a general rule, still expect to find mor variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation whic have remained for a much longer period nearly constant.
But as the vast majority o the species in the above two families, as well as most other crustaceans are aquatic in their habits, it is improbable in the highest degree tha their common progenitor should have been adapted for breathing air.
But as these animals and their spawn ar immediately killed (with the exception, as far as known, of one India species) by sea-water, there would be great difficulty in their transporta across the sea, and therefore we can see why they do not exist on strictl oceanic islands.
But as these are matters of general assent, which nobody dreams of objecting to, so also we have made no provision for enforcing them: therefore I don't call them laws.
But as these four last-mentioned instruments are scarcely so familiar as the simplest form of barometer, it may be useful to add a few words about each of them.
But as these tw groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents the new species (F14) will not be directly intermediate between them, bu rather between types of the two groups; and every naturalist will be abl to call such cases before his mind.
But as to the great improvement of the nineteenth century, I don't see it.
But as variations manifestly useful o pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearanc will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept.
But ask on, ask on! don't be shy of asking.
But assuredly, i this theory be true, such have lived upon the earth.
But at least she is spared the fear (it was most commonly the certainty) that artificial disabilities would make her children something less than men and women: she knows that they will live and act according to the measure of their own faculties.
But at other times doubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of her acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decided preference of a London life, what could he expect but a determined rejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated, demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as conscience must forbid.
But at your time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstance for yourself, and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight.
But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right.
But before she had come to the garden gate, out came Dick and Clara, who, after a minute's pause, came down to meet me, leaving Ellen in the garden; then we three went down to the boat, talking mere morning prattle.
But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor.
But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.
But besides C. livia, with it geographical sub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeon are known; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds.
But birds breeding on precipices, and good flyers, are unlikely t be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits wit the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of th smaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean.
But breed her up with them from this time, and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be more to either than a sister.
But by G - , you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour! I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds.
But cases of great difficulty, which I will not her enumerate, sometimes arise in deciding whether or not to rank one form as  variety of another, even when they are closely connected by intermediat links; nor will the commonly assumed hybrid nature of the intermediat forms always remove the difficulty.
But causes of serious error her intervene:  a plant, to be hybridised, must be castrated, and, what i often more important, must be secluded in order to prevent pollen bein brought to it by insects from other plants.
But certain Jurassic an Triassic forms are now commonly admitted to be teleostean; and even som palaeozoic forms have thus been classed by one high authority.
But certainly the people of those days must have been a curiously lazy set.
But come along; here is a place just handy.
But come ashore at once, Dick, and you, dear neighbours; there is a break in the reeds and a good landing-place just round the corner.
But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth - that wish of avoiding particularity! Dear ma'am, only look at her face at this moment; how different from what it was the two last dances! Miss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling with pleasure, and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her partner, Mr. Crawford, were close to her; they were all in a cluster together.
But do not stay here to be cold.
But do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth' history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash int living tissues?  Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation on individual or many were produced?  Were all the infinitely numerous kind of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in th case of mammals, were they created bearing the false marks of nourishmen from the mother's womb?  Undoubtedly some of these same questions cannot b answered by those who believe in the appearance or creation of only a fe forms of life or of some one form alone.
But during the process of modification, represented in the diagram, anothe of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played an importan part.
But each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations.
But enough of this.
But even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea.
But even some o these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms, which hav from some cause, possibly in part through facility of diffusion among th crowded animals, been disproportionally favoured:  and here comes in a sor of struggle between the parasite and its prey.
But even such structures have often, as we ma feel assured, been subsequently taken advantage of, and still furthe modified, for the good of species under new conditions of life.
But excuse me for being so prolix on this question! You know you asked to be treated like a being from another planet.
But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed.
But first let us look to a few analogous cases in ou domestic varieties.
But for the most part they practised 'masterly inactivity,' as it was then called - that is, they drew their salaries, and let things alone.
But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.
But from reasons already assigned I can by no means agree wit this naturalist, that migration and isolation are necessary elements fo the formation of new species.
But from th strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds, as peas and beans when sown in the midst of long grass, it may be suspected that the chie use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the seedlings whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around.
But geology show us, that from an early part of the tertiary period the number of species o shells, and that from the middle part of this same period, the number o mammals has not greatly or at all increased.
But go on, go on.
But h who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this firs degree of sterility could be increased through natural selection to tha high degree which is common with so many species, and which is universa with species which have been differentiated to a generic or family rank will find the subject extraordinarily complex.
But had she been less obstinate, or of less weight with her son, who was always guided by the last speaker, by the person who could get hold of and shut him up, the case would still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear again, and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford, who had quitted his uncle's house, as for a journey, on the very day of her absenting herself.
But have you heard about the Thrush? She is gone out of harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam's things, they will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders to-morrow, perhaps.
But have you no laws of the market, so to say - no regulation for the exchange of wares? for you must exchange, even if you have no property.
But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part.
But he does not show how selection acts unde nature.
But he has now received  trustworthy account of a young cuckoo which was actually seen, while stil blind and not able even to hold up its own head, in the act of ejecting it foster-brothers.
But he likewise believed in a law of progressiv development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to progress, in orde to account for the existence at the present day of simple productions, h maintains that such forms are now spontaneously generated.
But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.
But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name.
But he threw himself before her.
But he was master at Mansfield Park.
But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser's party; his staying was made of flattering consequence, and he was to meet Mrs. Rushworth there.
But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.
But her chief strength lay in Sotherton.
But her uncle's anger gave her the severest pain of all.
But here he comes again.
But here she hoped too much; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity.
But here we enter on a very intricat subject, for naturalists have not defined to each other's satisfaction wha is meant by an advance in organisation.
But hereditary diseases an some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension, an that, when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear a any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at th same period at which it first appeared in the parent.
But his heart failed him when he saw the squire; and he remained.
But his intention, the kindness of his intention, was thankfully acknowledged: quite thankfully and warmly, for she was elevated beyond the common timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for William.
But how false  view is this!  Every one has heard that when an American forest is cu down, a very different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed tha ancient Indian ruins in the Southern United States, which must formerl have been cleared of trees, now display the same beautiful diversity an proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests.
But how important a element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey.
But how is it that many of th immigrants have been differently modified, though only in a small degree in islands situated within sight of each other, having the same geologica nature, the same height, climate, etc?  This long appeared to me a grea difficulty:  but it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error o considering the physical conditions of a country as the most important whereas it cannot be disputed that the nature of the other species wit which each has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a fa more important element of success.
But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.
But how often do we see along the bases o retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all thickly clothed by marin productions, showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they ar rolled about!  Moreover, if we follow for a few miles any line of rock cliff, which is undergoing degradation, we find that it is only here an there, along a short length or round a promontory, that the cliffs are a the present time suffering.
But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature?   believe it can and does apply most efficiently (though it was a long tim before I saw how), from the simple circumstance that the more diversifie the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, an habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widel diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increas in numbers.
But however, what with the beasts and the men, and the scattered red-tiled roofs and the big hayricks, it does not make a bad holiday to get a quiet pony and ride about there on a sunny afternoon of autumn, and look over the river and the craft passing up and down, and on to Shooters' Hill and the Kentish uplands, and then turn round to the wide green sea of the Essex marsh-land, with the great domed line of the sky, and the sun shining down in one flood of peaceful light over the long distance.
But humanity has triumphed over clothes; the look, the touch of a dress has become alive; and the woman who stitched herself into these material integuments has now permeated right through and gone out to the tip of her skirt.
But i harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinctio between species and varieties.
But i many other cases, in which we have reason to believe that the species of  genus have been produced within comparatively recent times, there is grea difficulty on this head.
But i the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened an fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined t the elements of air and water.
But i variations useful to any organic being ever do occur, assuredly individual thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in th struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance, these wil tend to produce offspring similarly characterised.
But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business, of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall be well repaid.
But if I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting.
But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.
But if he wrote to his father, no wonder he was concise.
But if hi observations be widely extended he will in the end generally be able t make up his own mind; but he will succeed in this at the expense o admitting much variation, and the truth of this admission will often b disputed by other naturalists.
But if the Government could have treated their army as a real army, and used them strategically as a general would have done, looking on the people as a mere open enemy to be shot at and dispersed wherever they turned up, they would probably have gained the victory at the time.
But if the area be large its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions o life; and then, if the same species undergoes modification in differen districts, the newly formed varieties will intercross on the confines o each.
But if the conferva o parasitic fungus exceeds its allies in the above respects, it will then b dominant within its own class.
But if the sam species can be produced at two separate points, why do we not find a singl mammal common to Europe and Australia or South America?  The conditions o life are nearly the same, so that a multitude of European animals an plants have become naturalised in America and Australia; and some of th aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant points of th northern and southern hemispheres?  The answer, as I believe, is, tha mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from thei varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the wide and broke interspaces.
But if w compare these species where they intermingle, they are generally a absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as ar specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each.
But if we deny this, we must make one of the two followin highly improbable suppositions.
But if you do not like it, there is no more to be said.
But if you were free today, tomorrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl - you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you.
But if your mind is made up, so be it; I will beg no longer; I give you my orders; and I will not allow - not allow you to go hence alone.
But if, in fact, al hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross, the difference between them an unisexual species is, as far as function is concerned, very small.
But in Manchester, where the people were not so courageous or not so desperate as in London, several of the popular leaders were arrested.
But in a natural classification many fossi species certainly stand between living species, and some extinct gener between living genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families.
But in addition to this, several bakers' shops and other provision stores had been emptied without a great deal of disturbance.
But in all cases, speculation on an instinct known to u only in a single species, is useless, for we have hitherto had no facts t guide us.
But in all the foregoing cases the insects in their original state no doub presented some rude and accidental resemblance to an object commonly foun in the stations frequented by them.
But in any case I shouldn't have kept you out of it for long, since I am due in the hay-fields in a few days.
But in ascending the series from simple twiners to leaf-climbers an important quality is added, namely sensitiveness to a touch, by whic means the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or these modified an converted into tendrils, are excited to bend round and clasp the touchin object.
But in making these and the following remarks, I am compelle to allude to subjects hereafter to be discussed.
But in many cases victory depends not so much o general vigour, but on having special weapons, confined to the male sex.
But in most points, the theory accorded rudely with the facts; and its author had calculated the relative position of the caraffe, the table, the walls, the chimney piece ornaments and the eight-day clock, to the millionth place of decimals, for his instruments and methods were exquisitely fine.
But in some gener the larvae become developed into hermaphrodites having the ordinar structure, or into what I have called complemental males; and in the latte the development has assuredly been retrograde; for the male is a mere sack which lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth, stomach, and ever other organ of importance, excepting those for reproduction.
But in some of these plant the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture.
But in spite of all that had happened, my hand went down into my pocket again, where to my dismay it met nothing metallic except two rusty old keys, and I remembered that amidst our talk in the guest-hall at Hammersmith I had taken the cash out of my pocket to show to the pretty Annie, and had left it lying there.
But in th case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, int which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should the have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better fille up if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for had the area been open to immigration, these same places would have bee seized on by intruders.
But in the caves o Brazil there are many extinct species which are closely allied in size an in all other characters to the species still living in South America; an some of these fossils may have been the actual progenitors of the livin species.
But in the great majority of cases, namely, with al organisms which habitually unite for each birth, or which occasionall intercross, the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same are will be kept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals wil go on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at eac stage will not be due to descent from a single parent.
But in the intermediat region, having intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now fin closely-linking intermediate varieties?  This difficulty for a long tim quite confounded me.
But in the meantime you must go home.
But in the meantime, sir, no false pride; we must stay with our friends; we must sponge a while on Papa Van Tromp, who has sponged so often upon us.
But in these and in many other cases Gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in order to show tha there is any degree of sterility.
But in those past days you, grandfather, would have had to work hard after you were old; and would have been always afraid of having to be shut up in a kind of prison along with other old men, half-starved and without amusement.
But insuperable difficulties, as i seems to me, prevent us from coming to any just conclusion on this head.
But it by no means follows that, because in a island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar, those of anothe class, or of another section of the same class, are peculiar; and thi difference seems to depend partly on the species which are not modifie having immigrated in a body, so that their mutual relations have not bee much disturbed; and partly on the frequent arrival of unmodified immigrant from the mother-country, with which the insular forms have intercrossed.
But it cannot be supposed that th peculiar speckled appearance of the upper side of the sole, so like th sandy bed of the sea, or the power in some species, as recently shown b Pouchet, of changing their colour in accordance with the surroundin surface, or the presence of bony tubercles on the upper side of the turbot are due to the action of the light.
But it deserves especial notice that the more importan objections relate to questions on which we are confessedly ignorant; nor d we know how ignorant we are.
But it did not answer on that score; for of course people came there, as the place is not a desert, and they seemed to find me all the more interesting for living alone like that, and fell to making stories of me to themselves - like I know you did, my friend.
But it did not last long, only about a year.
But it did not work smoothly; it was, of course, resisted at every turn by the capitalists; and no wonder, for it tended more and more to upset the commercial system I have told you of; without providing anything really effective in its place.
But it does not follow fro this fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it i possible to conceive under all possible conditions.
But it had undergone a surprising transformation.
But it is also necessar to assume that many sub-arctic and some few temperate forms were the sam round the world, for some of the species which now exist on the lowe mountain slopes and on the plains of North America and Europe are the same and it may be asked how I account for this degree of uniformity of th sub-arctic and temperate forms round the world, at the commencement of th real Glacial period.
But it is by no means obvious, on th ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should be more important fo this purpose than that of the adult, which alone plays its full part in th economy of nature.
But it is capable of much more.
But it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchia might have been gradually worked in by natural selection for some distinc purpose:  for instance, Landois has shown that the wings of insects ar developed from the trachea; it is therefore highly probable that in thi great class organs which once served for respiration have been actuall converted into organs for flight.
But it is impossible to attribute to this cause th innumerable structures which are so well adapted to the habits of life o each species.
But it is impossible to resist th evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the fe following cases, which I will briefly abstract.
But it is not to be a display of that sort.
But it is very far from true that th principle is a modern discovery.
But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies - about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows, without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished and pleasing, and one very pretty.
But it is very pleasant there, partly because of the splendour of the architecture, which goes further than what you will see elsewhere.
But it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to rise in th scale, how is it that throughout the world a multitude of the lowest form still exist; and how is it that in each great class some forms are far mor highly developed than others?  Why have not the more highly developed form every where supplanted and exterminated the lower?  Lamarck, who believe in an innate and inevitable tendency towards perfection in all organi beings, seems to have felt this difficulty so strongly that he was led t suppose that new and simple forms are continually being produced b spontaneous generation.
But it may be urged that when several closely allied species inhabit th same territory, we surely ought to find at the present time man transitional forms.
But it must often have happened that a ne species belonging to some one group has seized on the place occupied by  species belonging to a distinct group, and thus have caused it extermination.
But it was not to be avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William, he was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit.
But it was not to be.
But it was possible to part with her, because Susan remained to supply her place.
But it was very different.
But it was, of course, clear that unless this meant a higher price for work per hour, it would be a mere nullity, and that the masters, unless forced, would reduce it to that.
But it will have bee otherwise with the nascent giraffe, considering its probable habits o life; for those individuals which had some one part or several parts o their bodies rather more elongated than usual, would generally hav survived.
But it will not.
But it would b a serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have bee acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted by inheritance t succeeding generations.
But it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail:  for wit plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed specie must be due to some principle, quite independent of natural selection.
But it would in most cases be extremely rash t attribute to convergence a close and general similarity of structure in th modified descendants of widely distinct forms.
But its best ornament was the crowd of handsome, happy-looking men and women that were set down to table, and who, with their bright faces and rich hair over their gay holiday raiment, looked, as the Persian poet puts it, like a bed of tulips in the sun.
But just as Dick was getting the sculls into the rowlocks, the bows of another boat came thrusting through the low arch.
But just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on a enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which hav formerly existed, be truly enormous.
But later on, I hope, we may have some more talk together, when our friend Dick isn't here.
But let it be born in mind, in relation to the subject of this work, what a hundred year implies, represented as it is by a measure utterly insignificant in a hal of the above dimensions.
But let me remind you that you owe some apologies to this young lady also.
But let th destruction of the adults be ever so heavy, if the number which can exis in any district be not wholly kept down by such causes - or again let th destruction of eggs or seeds be so great that only a hundredth or  thousandth part are developed - yet of those which do survive, the bes adapted individuals, supposing that there is any variability in  favourable direction, will tend to propagate their kind in larger number than the less well adapted.
But let that pass.
But let us look to th familiar case of the breeds of dogs:  it cannot be doubted that youn pointers (I have myself seen striking instances) will sometimes point an even back other dogs the very first time that they are taken out retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers; and  tendency to run round, instead of at, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs.
But let us suppose that this latter circumstanc determined, as it probably often has determined, whether a bee allied t our humble-bees could exist in large numbers in any country; and let u further suppose that the community lived through the winter, an consequently required a store of honey:  there can in this case be no doub that it would be an advantage to our imaginary humble-bee if a sligh modification of her instincts led her to make her waxen cells nea together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in common even to tw adjoining cells would save some little labour and wax.
But let us walk, if you prefer it.
But look you, just in the degree that a man had elevation of mind and refinement enough to be able to value this idea, was he repelled by the obvious aspect of the individuals composing the mass which he was to worship; and he could only evade that repulsion by making a conventional abstraction of mankind that had little actual or historical relation to the race; which to his eyes was divided into blind tyrants on the one hand and apathetic degraded slaves on the other.
But mama kept it from her, and was always letting Betsey get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it, and get it for her own, though mama had promised her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands.
But mammals and fish hardly come into competition with eac other; the advancement of the whole class of mammals, or of certain member in this class, to the highest grade would not lead to their taking th place of fishes.
But man can and does select th variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulates them in any desire manner.
But man often neglects his perceptive and reasoning powers; neither himself observes, nor attends to the observations of others, unless special inclination or circumstances stimulate attention to the subject.
But manner Fanny did not want.
But many naturalists think that something more is meant b the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the plan of the Creator but unless it be specified whether order in time or space, or both, or wha else is meant by the plan of the Creator, it seems to me that nothing i thus added to our knowledge.
But may not the areas o preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages?  At a period lon antecedent to the Cambrian epoch, continents may have existed where ocean are now spread out, and clear and open oceans may have existed where ou continents now stand.
But may not this inference b presumptuous?  Have we any right to assume that the Creator works b intellectual powers like those of man?  If we must compare the eye to a optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer o transparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a nerv sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer to b continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate into layers o different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances fro each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form.
But morphology is a much more complex subject than it at first appears, a has lately been well shown in a remarkable paper by Mr. E. Ray Lankester who has drawn an important distinction between certain classes of case which have all been equally ranked by naturalists as homologous.
But my astonishment was groundless.
But my father used to know some of them when they were young; and he said that they were as little like young women as might be: they had hands like bunches of skewers, and wretched little arms like sticks; and waists like hour-glasses, and thin lips and peaked noses and pale cheeks; and they were always pretending to be offended at anything you said or did to them.
But my friend Walter Allen, who asked me to stop here, lives in a house, not very big, which has been built here lately, because these meadows are so much liked, especially in summer, that there was getting to be rather too much of tenting on the open field; so the parishes here about, who rather objected to that, built three houses between this and Caversham, and quite a large one at Basildon, a little higher up.
But my tables furthe show that, in any limited country, the species which are the most common that is abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widel diffused within their own country (and this is a different consideratio from wide range, and to a certain extent from commonness), oftenest giv rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded i botanical works.
But my work had hardly been published, when  skilful palaeontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfec specimen of an unmistakable sessile cirripede, which he had himsel extracted from the chalk of Belgium.
But natural selection can and does often produce structures fo the direct injury of other animals, as we see in the fang of the adder, an in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs are deposited in th living bodies of other insects.
But no change came as yet, and my heart swelled with joy as I thought of all the beautiful grey villages, from the river to the plain and the plain to the uplands, which I could picture to myself so well, all peopled now with this happy and lovely folk, who had cast away riches and attained to wealth.
But no observer can determine for another even if he can do so for himself, which of these Phytophagic forms ought t be called species and which varieties.
But no on probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar.
But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared.
But nothing was of avail against the squire.
But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price.
But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents.
But now hadn't we better make haste to see your great-grandfather? In fact, I could not help seeing that he was rather dallying with the time.
But now it's time for you to be gone, if you are to have the best of the tide, and also of the sunny morning.
But now that the times called for immediate action, came forward the men capable of setting it on foot; and a new network of workmen's associations grew up very speedily, whose avowed single object was the tiding over of the ship of the community into a simple condition of Communism; and as they practically undertook also the management of the ordinary labour-war, they soon became the mouthpiece and intermediary of the whole of the working classes; and the manufacturing profit-grinders now found themselves powerless before this combination; unless their committee, Parliament, plucked up courage to begin the civil war again, and to shoot right and left, they were bound to yield to the demands of the men whom they employed, and pay higher and higher wages for shorter and shorter day's work.
But now that they were alone, she became conscious of a barrier between her lover and herself, and alarm sprang up in her heart.
But now, Guest, we are so near to my old kinsman's dwelling-place that I think you had better keep all future questions for him.
But now, Mr. Croll, in a series of admirable memoirs, ha attempted to show that a glacial condition of climate is the result o various physical causes, brought into operation by an increase in th eccentricity of the earth's orbit.
But now, where is the difficulty in accepting the religion of humanity, when the men and women who go to make up humanity are free, happy, and energetic at least, and most commonly beautiful of body also, and surrounded by beautiful things of their own fashioning, and a nature bettered and not worsened by contact with mankind? This is what this age of the world has reserved for us.
But o the view of each species constantly trying to increase in number, wit natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants o each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature, these facts ceas to be strange, or might even have been anticipated.
But of course he could live in a prettier house if he liked: he is not obliged to live in one place any more than any one else.
But of course to the privileged classes it seemed as if the end of the world were come when such laws were enacted.
But of what? What had I been saying to displease you? Did you think me speaking improperly, lightly, irreverently on the subject? Only tell me if I was.
But on looking closely between the stems of th heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had bee perpetually browsed down by the cattle.
But on the Monday in question the Committee of Public Safety, on the one hand afraid of general unorganised pillage, and on the other emboldened by the wavering conduct of the authorities, sent a deputation provided with carts and all necessary gear to clear out two or three big provision stores in the centre of the town, leaving papers with the shop managers promising to pay the price of them: and also in the part of the town where they were strongest they took possession of several bakers' shops and set men at work in them for the benefit of the people; - all of which was done with little or no disturbance, the police assisting in keeping order at the sack of the stores, as they would have done at a big fire.
But on the view that groups of species are descended fro some other species, and have been modified through natural selection,  think we can obtain some light.
But on the view that species ar only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might expect often to fin them still continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which hav varied within a moderately recent period, and which have thus come t differ.
But one of these five varieties, when used either as the fathe or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrid not so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varietie when crossed with N. glutinosa.
But perhaps you mean that you have read about it in books, and seen pictures of it? - though that does not come to much, either.
But plants possess, in obedience to various stimuli powers of movement, which are of manifest importance to them; for instance towards and more rarely from the light - in opposition to, and more rarel in the direction of, the attraction of gravity.
But probably the most important element i that the animal or plant should be so highly valued by man, that th closest attention is paid to even the slightest deviations in its qualitie or structure.
But reflection brought better feelings, and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect, which could never have belonged to her; and that, had she received even the greatest, she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which, considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether.
But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.
But seals would not find on oceanic islands the condition favourable to their gradual reconversion into a terrestrial form.
But see, here is a stranger who is willing to amuse me to-day by taking me as his guide about our country-side, and you may imagine I don't want to lose the opportunity; so you had better take to the boat at once.
But severa seedling mistletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may mor truly be said to struggle with each other.
But she had more than fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feel undecided as to what she ought to do; and as she walked round the room her doubts were increasing.
But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other.
But she has always done justice to you.
But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.
But she still tried to believe it no more than what he might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty other women.
But she was so wholly unused to confer favours, except on the very poor, so unpractised in removing evils, or bestowing kindnesses among her equals, and so fearful of appearing to elevate herself as a great lady at home, that it took some time to determine that it would not be unbecoming in her to make such a present.
But slowly as the recovery came, it did come; and the more you see of us, the clearer it will be to you that we are happy.
But so many causes tend to obscure thi result, that I am surprised that my tables show even a small majority o the side of the larger genera.
But som arguments of the greatest weight extend very far.
But some people like their looks better than ours; they say they have more character in them - that's the word.
But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces.
But still I am not frightened.
But still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction.
But still there are man hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair, and a vas majority of plants are hermaphrodites.
But success wil often depend on the males having special weapons or means of defence o charms; and a slight advantage will lead to victory.
But such  case would imply that one form had remained for a very long perio unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change and the principle of competition between organism and organism, betwee child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all cases th new and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and unimprove forms.
But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being a gradua increase in number, until the group reaches its maximum, and then, soone or later, a gradual decrease.
But such is not the case.
But suppose a long reservoir or canal of fluid which has two such points of exhaustion or two of such repletion, and that one of either is near each end of the vessel.
But supposing for a instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the firs appearance and disappearance of the species was complete, which is far fro the case, we have no reason to believe that forms successively produce necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time.
But supposing the affair proposed and seconded, if a few of the neighbours disagree to it, if they think that the beastly iron bridge will serve a little longer and they don't want to be bothered with building a new one just then, they don't count heads that time, but put off the formal discussion to the next Mote; and meantime arguments pro and con are flying about, and some get printed, so that everybody knows what is going on; and when the Mote comes together again there is a regular discussion and at last a vote by show of hands.
But surely there need be no wonder in that, since you have been travelling; and clearly from all you have been saying, in unsocial countries.
But t discuss whether they ought to be called species or varieties, before an definition of these terms has been generally accepted, is vainly to bea the air.
But t suppose that most of the many now existing low forms have not in the leas advanced since the first dawn of life would be extremely rash; for ever naturalist who has dissected some of the beings now ranked as very low i the scale, must have been struck with their really wondrous and beautifu organisation.
But taste was too strong in her.
But terrible tragedy lay hidden behind this grinning through a horse-collar of the reactionary party.
But th fertility of first crosses is likewise innately variable; for it is no always the same in degree when the same two species are crossed under th same circumstances; it depends in part upon the constitution of th individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment.
But th geographical and climatical changes which have certainly occurred withi recent geological times, must have rendered discontinuous the formerl continuous range of many species.
But th important fact for us is that, though the workers can be grouped int castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly into each other, a does the widely-different structure of their jaws.
But th main cause lies in the fact that under very simple conditions of life  high organisation would be of no service - possibly would be of actua disservice, as being of a more delicate nature, and more liable to be pu out of order and injured.
But th young kangaroo is said not to suck, only to cling to the nipple of it mother, who has the power of injecting milk into the mouth of her helpless half-formed offspring.
But that our rule is not confined to secondary sexua characters is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes;  particularly attended to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating thi order, and I am fully convinced that the rule almost always holds good.
But the Admiral, after a pause, decided for the brandy at home, and made off in that direction.
But the American cuckoo is in this predicament, for sh makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched, all at th same time.
But the amount of modification which the different groups hav undergone has to be expressed by ranking them under different so-calle genera, subfamilies, families, sections, orders, and classes.
But the best evidence of analogou variations is afforded by parts or organs which are generally constant i character, but which occasionally vary so as to resemble, in some degree the same part or organ in an allied species.
But the bulb of the tube is full of mercury which contracts by cold, and swells by heat - according to which effect the thread of metal in the small tube is drawn down or pushed up so many degrees: and thus shows the temperature.
But the cas of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old possessed it proper characters, proves that this is not the universal rule; for here th characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier perio than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not a a corresponding, but at an earlier age.
But the case is exactly the reverse.
But the case is very different; and Alph.
But the chanc will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow varying, and insensible changes.
But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one specie has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slo in admitting any great changes of which we do not see the steps.
But the coasting vessel puts to sea, the Shetland fisherman casts his nets without the benefit of such a monitor, and perhaps without the weather wisdom which only a few possess, and cannot transfer to others.
But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two: there was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being reassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a separate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it was, could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful joy.
But the correspondence between systematic affinity and th facility of crossing is by no means strict.
But the degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which the live is often overrated.
But the descriptions which we possess of th Silurian deposits over immense territories in Russia and in North America do not support the view that the older a formation is the more invariabl it has suffered extreme denudation and metamorphism.
But the difficulty is no nearly so great as at first appears:  all this beautiful work can be shown I think, to follow from a few simple instincts.
But the discrepancy was small; and the most solid of the free thinkers was conscious of a private doubt.
But the evil ready to burst on her was at least delayed by the sudden change in Miss Crawford's ideas; by the strong effect on her mind which the finding herself in the East room again produced.
But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of th Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equall convenient.
But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for the are both placed on the upper side of the head.
But the fact of variations and monstrosities occurring muc more frequently under domestication than under nature, and the greate variability of species having wide ranges than of those with restricte ranges, lead to the conclusion that variability is generally related to th conditions of life to which each species has been exposed during severa successive generations.
But the following fact is more important:  th crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not, as I know b trial, injure in the least the germination of seeds; now, after a bird ha found and devoured a large supply of food, it is positively asserted tha all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for twelve or even eightee hours.
But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder.
But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pear which they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their havin naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.
But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.
But the girl took a dainty little basket from a shelf beside her, went to a jar, and took out a lot of tobacco and put the filled basket down on the counter before me, where I could both smell and see that it was excellent Latakia.
But the girl's suspicions were aroused; and though she pressed the matter no farther (indeed, her father was already seen returning), it by no means left her thoughts.
But the imperfection in the geological record largely results from anothe and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from th several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals o time.
But the important point to notice is, that these cells ar always made at that degree of nearness to each other that they would hav intersected or broken into each other if the spheres had been completed but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wa between the spheres which thus tend to intersect.
But the islands, though in sight of each other, are separated b deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British Channel, an there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period bee continuously united.
But the long series of years during which the workmen had learned to despise their rulers, had done away with their dependence upon them, and they were now beginning to trust (somewhat dangerously, as events proved) in the non-legal leaders whom events had thrust forward; and though most of these were now become mere figure-heads, their names and reputations were useful in this crisis as a stop-gap.
But the main element of their success was this, that wherever the working people were not coerced, they worked, not for the reactionists, but for 'the rebels.' The reactionists could get no work done for them outside the districts where they were all-powerful: and even in those districts they were harassed by continual risings; and in all cases and everywhere got nothing done without obstruction and black looks and sulkiness; so that not only were their armies quite worn out with the difficulties which they had to meet, but the non-combatants who were on their side were so worried and beset with hatred and a thousand little troubles and annoyances that life became almost unendurable to them on those terms.
But the matter does not end here.
But the mere existence of individual variability and of som few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature.
But the most important resul for us, arrived at by Mr. Croll, is that whenever the northern hemispher passes through a cold period the temperature of the southern hemisphere i actually raised, with the winters rendered much milder, chiefly throug changes in the direction of the ocean currents.
But the numbe and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of sligh and those of considerable physiological importance, are endless.
But the other: the first! She had never heard him speak so openly before, and though it told her no more than what she had long perceived, it was a stab, for it told of his own convictions and views.
But the philosopher was a man of a devout, obedient mind; and he had chosen to accept and build upon a legend of the race.
But the philosopher went further still.
But the principal point fo a seaman is, that no violent wind will blow without the barometer giving warning.
But the probability of other islands having onc existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains, must not b overlooked.
But the real importanc of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction a some period of life; and this period in the great majority of cases is a early one.
But the roug wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being largely gnawe away on both sides.
But the species left during a long tim on these mountains, or in opposite hemispheres, would have to compete wit many new forms and would be exposed to somewhat different physica conditions; hence, they would be eminently liable to modification, an would generally now exist as varieties or as representative species; an this is the case.
But the state of the same organ in distinc classes may incidentally throw light on the steps by which it has bee perfected.
But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.
But the struggle will almost invariably be mos severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent th same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers.
But the subject is surrounded by difficulties, for, looking to varietie produced under nature, if two forms hitherto reputed to be varieties b found in any degree sterile together, they are at once ranked by mos naturalists as species.
But the three genera o the left hand have, on this same principle, much in common, and form  subfamily, distinct from that containing the next two genera on the righ hand, which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent.
But the truth is, that my father hardly knows them.
But the utter extinction of a whole group of species has sometime been a slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering i protected and isolated situations.
But the value o this evidence depends entirely on the perfection of the geological record in relation to periods remote in the history of the world.
But the variability, which we almost universally mee with in our domestic productions is not directly produced, as Hooker an Asa Gray have well remarked, by man; he can neither originate varieties no prevent their occurrence; he can only preserve and accumulate such as d occur.
But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.
But the wide distribution o fresh-water plants, and of the lower animals, whether retaining the sam identical form, or in some degree modified, apparently depends in main par on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especiall by fresh-water birds, which have great powers of flight, and naturall travel from one piece of water to another.
But the wide ranging power of fresh-water productions can, I think, in mos cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner highly usefu to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond, or fro stream to stream, within their own countries; and liability to wid dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessar consequence.
But the will as yet hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightl valued, their history will have been disregarded.
But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for.
But the woods are fine, and there is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good deal of.
But then you see that was written of Syria, a hot dry country, where people live faster than in our temperate climate.
But then, I must have a London audience.
But ther is reason to believe that the species which are very closely allied t other species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have much restricte ranges.
But there IS a special provision.
But there can be no doubt that embryonic excluding larval characters, are of the highest value for classification not only with animals but with plants.
But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.
But there he is, and, by the bye, his absence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister's in writing, for there has been no 'Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny? Is not it time for you to write to Fanny?' to spur me on.
But there is n doubt that besides removing dirt of all kinds, they subserve othe functions; and one of these apparently is defence.
But there is no reason why for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should not hav been sketched out with all their parts in proper proportion, as soon as an part became visible.
But there is no time fixed; perhaps to-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough.
But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund.
But there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view:  to asser that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horne cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for a unlimited number of generations, would be opposed to all experience.
But there they were, in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.
But there was another opinion, far less logical, prevalent amongst the rich people before the days of freedom, which did not die out at once after that epoch had begun.
But there was happiness elsewhere which no description can reach.
But there was one remarkable exception to this rule, for the youn of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon and of the other breeds, in almost exactly the same proportions as in th adult stage.
But these breaks are imaginary, and might have been inserte anywhere, after intervals long enough to allow the accumulation of  considerable amount of divergent variation.
But these organs in the Articulata are so much diversified tha Muller formerly made three main classes with seven subdivisions, besides  fourth main class of aggregated simple eyes.

But they didn�t devote the whole evening to music.
But they found no word of reference to the great subject.
But they had seen no one from the Parsonage, not a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of congratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram.
But they were determined to try first a weapon which they thought stronger than street fighting.
But they were too much used to company and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their confidence increasing from their cousin's total want of it, they were soon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy indifference.
But thi capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed b systematic affinity.
But thi conclusion, as far as I can make out, is founded on a single experiment and seems directly opposed to the results of several experiments made b Kolreuter.
But this I will say, that his fault, the liking to make girls a little in love with him, is not half so dangerous to a wife's happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself, which he has never been addicted to.
But this beauty serves merely as a guide to bird and beasts, in order that the fruit may be devoured and the matured seed disseminated.
But this could not impose on Fanny.
But this difference does not determine how many individuals of the tw species can be supported in a district.
But this difficulty partiall disappears on the view that New Zealand, South America, and the othe southern lands, have been stocked in part from a nearly intermediate thoug distant point, namely, from the antarctic islands, when they were clothe with vegetation, during a warmer tertiary period, before the commencemen of the last Glacial period.
But this frame of mind he was so used to, that it didn't last him long, and after a brief discomfort, caused by disgust with himself for having lost his temper (which he was also well used to), he found himself musing on the subject-matter of discussion, but still discontentedly and unhappily.
But this genus, though muc isolated, will still occupy its proper intermediate position.
But this had occurred on the first day of its being settled, within the first hour of the burst of such enjoyment, when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before her.
But this has been effected through sexual selection that is, by the more beautiful males having been continually preferred b the females, and not for the delight of man.
But this he stoutly denied.
But this inferenc is chiefly grounded on analogy, and it is immaterial whether or not it b accepted.
But this is a false view; we forget that each species even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction a some period of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the sam place and food; and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degre favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers and as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the othe species must decrease.
But this is a wholl false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between eac species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor wil generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants.
But this is no surprising, for we do not even know of what use they are.
But this is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasiona means of transport, during the long lapse of geological time, whilst th island was being upheaved, and before it had become fully stocked wit inhabitants.
But this is teasing you.
But this must be learned to be endured.
But this only throws far backward the history o civilisation, and shows that animals were domesticated at a much earlie period than has hitherto been supposed.
But this ought not to be expected; yet this has bee repeatedly advanced as a most serious objection against my views.
But this principle will almos necessarily be confined to the earlier stages of the process of reduction for we cannot suppose that a minute papilla, for instance, representing i a male flower the pistil of the female flower, and formed merely o cellular tissue, could be further reduced or absorbed for the sake o economising nutriment.
But this resemblance is confined t general appearance, as in the prominence of the canines, and in the cuttin shape of the molar teeth.
But this same movement of subsidence will tend to submerge the area whenc the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the supply, whilst the downwar movement continues.
But this subject need not here be discussed.
But this the Spirit said could not be done.
But this theory can be tested by experiment.
But this view may be safely rejected, for it is highly improbabl that the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welsh ponies, Norwegian cobs, the lank Kattywar race, etc., inhabiting the most distant parts of the world, shoul have all have been crossed with one supposed aboriginal stock.
But this was an unworthy feeling.
But this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of Amelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she would accept it.
But this was only the beginning of her surprise.
But those whom he obliged could always buy one of his villainous little pictures, or, where the favours had been prolonged and more than usually delicate, might order and pay for a large canvas, with perfect certainty that they would hear no more of the transaction.
But though I shall soon see some of these villages, tell me in a word or two what they are like, just to prepare me.
But though her wishes were overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring within her.
But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were difficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of another, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and knowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday, trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these.
But though she had seen all the members of the family, she had not yet heard all the noise they could make.
But though the conference had seemed full long to him, and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation, he inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened to without some profit to the speaker.
But till it is absolutely settled -  settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the matter.
But to extend it so far as to suppose that species aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers, pouters, and fantails no are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, inter se, seems to me ras in the extreme.
But to go from here without a plan, without forethought, in the heat of a moment, is madder than madness, and can help nothing.
But to mak the case sure, he would raise plants from his supposed hybridised seed, an he would find that the seedlings were miserably dwarfed and utterl sterile, and that they behaved in all other respects like ordinary hybrids.
But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids:  Gartner state that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent form but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in degree.
But to return to our imaginary case; as soon a the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen wa regularly carried from flower to flower, another process might commence.
But to use such an expression as trying to mak a fantail is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect.
But toward the extremity of the beak they differ much, as they project inward, instea of straight downward.
But two facts which I have observed - and many others no doubt will be discovered - thro some light on this subject.
But undoubtedly this was th general belief when the first edition of the present work appeared.
But unluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and hardship.
But useful as these general conclusions are in most cases they are sometimes erroneous, and then remarks may be rather hastily made, tending to discourage the inexperienced.
But w often take, I think, an erroneous view of the probability of closely allie species invading each other's territory, when put into fre intercommunication.
But we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relativ importance of the several known and unknown causes of variation; and I hav made these remarks only to show that, if we are unable to account for th characteristic differences of our several domestic breeds, whic nevertheless are generally admitted to have arisen through ordinar generation from one or a few parent-stocks, we ought not to lay too muc stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogou differences between true species.
But we can see that species, owing to thei struggle for existence with numerous competitors, will have been expose during long periods of time to more uniform conditions, than have domesti varieties; and this may well make a wide difference in the result.
But we continually overrate the perfection of the geologica record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or families have not bee found beneath a certain stage, that they did not exist before that stage.
But we coul not have told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked it increase, whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period o the horse's life, and in what degree they severally acted.
But we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals betwee the several successive formations; whether Europe and the United State during these intervals existed as dry land, or as a submarine surface nea land, on which sediment was not deposited, or as the bed of an open an unfathomable sea.
But we have already seen how it entails extinction; and how largel extinction has acted in the world's history, geology plainly declares.
But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretica calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingl rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstance have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons.
But we have no reason t assume that things have thus remained from the beginning of the world.
But we have no such people in Mansfield.
But we have not as yet touched on the acme of the difficulty; namely, th fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the fertil females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost incredibl degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes.
But we have seen that a thick formation fossiliferous throughout its entire thickness, can accumulate only during  period of subsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the same, whic is necessary that the same marine species may live on the same space, th supply of sediment must nearly counterbalance the amount of subsidence.
But we know, for instance, from Sir R. Murchison' great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are in that country between th superimposed formations; so it is in North America, and in many other part of the world.
But we learn from the study of our domestic productions that th disuse of parts leads to their reduced size; and that the result i inherited.
But we may go further than this.
But we may go further than this; for as ne forms are produced, unless we admit that specific forms can go o indefinitely increasing in number, many old forms must become extinct.
But we may safely conclude that th innumerable complex co-adaptations of structure, which we see throughou nature between various organic beings, cannot be attributed simply to suc action.
But we may thus deceive ourselves, fo to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large open area like  continent, has been most favourable for the production of new organi forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal times; and this we ar incapable of doing.
But we must return to our more immediate subject.
But we shall be able to gauge wit some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of th preceding and succeeding organic forms.
But we shall follow the changes more readily, by supposing a ne glacial period slowly to come on, and then pass away, as formerly occurred.
But we shall hereafter return to this subject.
But we shall see ho obscure this subject is if we look, for instance, to fishes, among whic some naturalists rank those as highest which, like the sharks, approac nearest to amphibians; while other naturalists rank the common bony o teleostean fishes as the highest, inasmuch as they are most strictly fish like, and differ most from the other vertebrate classes.
But we shall see in the sixth chapter that intermediate varieties inhabiting intermediate districts, will in the long run generally b supplanted by one of the adjoining varieties.
But we shall see.
But we who live amongst our friends need neither fear nor punish.
But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I should never have done.
But what availed his expressions or his air? He was going, and, if not voluntarily going, voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting what might be due to his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed.
But what concerns us is tha the domestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almos every character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do th distinct species of the same genera.
But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked.
But what here more particularly concerns us is, that thos points in our domestic animals, which at the present time are undergoin rapid change by continued selection, are also eminently liable t variation.
But what i meant by this system?  Some authors look at it merely as a scheme fo arranging together those living objects which are most alike, and fo separating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial method o enunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions - that is, by on sentence to give the characters common, for instance, to all mammals, b another those common to all carnivora, by another those common to th dog-genus, and then, by adding a single sentence, a full description i given of each kind of dog.
But what is to be done? We can't get anyone amongst us to complain of his not always having his own way in the teeth of the community, when it is clear that everybody cannot have that indulgence.
But what you were saying about the building being stopped and the trees growing is only too good news; - only you know -  At that point I suddenly remembered Dick's date, and stopped short rather confused.
But whe a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the offsprin occasionally show for many generations a tendency to revert in character t the foreign breed - some say, for a dozen or even a score of generations.
But when a species with a extraordinarily developed organ has become the parent of many modifie descendants - which on our view must be a very slow process, requiring  long lapse of time - in this case, natural selection has succeeded in givin a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a manner it ma have been developed.
But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable.
But when man is the selecting agent, we clearly see that the tw elements of change are distinct; variability is in some manner excited, bu it is the will of man which accumulates the variations in certai direction; and it is this latter agency which answers to the survival o the fittest under nature.
But when many men, without intending to alter th breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to procur and breed from the best animals, improvement surely but slowly follows fro this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding that there is n separation of selected individuals.
But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head, nothing can stop her.
But when the Corporation of London took it over about twenty-five years ago, the topping and lopping, which was a part of the old commoners' rights, came to an end, and the trees were let to grow.
But when the matter is of common interest to the whole community, and the doing or not doing something affects everybody, the majority must have their way; unless the minority were to take up arms and show by force that they were the effective or real majority; which, however, in a society of men who are free and equal is little likely to happen; because in such a community the apparent majority is the real majority, and the others, as I have hinted before, know that too well to obstruct from mere pigheadedness; especially as they have had plenty of opportunity of putting forward their side of the question.
But when the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed i a row, though most of them could just be distinguished, the proportiona differences in the above specified points were incomparably less than i the full-grown birds.
But when the railways - of which no doubt you have heard - came into power, they would not allow the people of the country to use either the natural or artificial waterways, of which latter there were a great many.
But when they called to mind that the soldiery in that 'Battle' of Trafalgar Square were so daunted by the slaughter which they had made, that they could not be got to fire a second volley, they shrank back again from the dreadful courage necessary for carrying out another massacre.
But when w come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of divergence of character, w shall see how this may be explained, and how the lesser differences betwee varieties tend to increase into the greater differences between species.
But when we bear in mind that almos every species, even in its metropolis, would increase immensely in numbers were it not for other competing species; that nearly all either prey on o serve as prey for others; in short, that each organic being is eithe directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to othe organic beings - we see that the range of the inhabitants of any country b no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical conditions but in large part on the presence of other species, on which it lives, o by which it is destroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and a these species are already defined objects, not blending one into another b insensible gradations, the range of any one species, depending as it doe on the range of others, will tend to be sharply defined.
But when we look at the subject mor closely, we find in the several fishes provided with electric organs, tha these are situated in different parts of the body, that they differ i construction, as in the arrangement of the plates, and, according t Pacini, in the process or means by which the electricity is excited - an lastly, in being supplied with nerves proceeding from different sources and this is perhaps the most important of all the differences.
But when, from the nature of the organism and of th conditions, modifications have been induced which are unimportant for th welfare of the species, they may be, and apparently often have been transmitted in nearly the same state to numerous, otherwise modified descendants.
But when, throwing one arm round her waist, he sought to kiss her lips, not like a lover indeed, not because he wanted to do so, but as a desperate man who puts his fortunes to the touch, she drew away from him, with a knot in her forehead, backed and shied about fiercely with her head, and pushed him from her with her hand.
But whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison, th same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences betwee varieties of the same species, and the greater differences between specie of the same genus.
But whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinc class, which have yielded their places to other modified and improve species, a few of the sufferers may often be preserved for a long time from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or from inhabiting som distant and isolated station, where they will have escaped sever competition.
But whether it is true, we can judge only by seeing how fa the hypothesis accords with and explains the general phenomena of nature.
But whether or not this adaptation is in most cases very close we have evidence with some few plants, of their becoming, to a certai extent, naturally habituated to different temperatures; that is, the become acclimatised:  thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from see collected by Dr. Hooker from the same species growing at different height on the Himalayas, were found to possess in this country differen constitutional powers of resisting cold.
But which groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict for we know that many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have no become extinct.
But why the rich men, who had the time and the leisure and the materials for building, as it would be in this case, should not have housed themselves well, I do not understand as yet.
But why this should be a law of nature i each species has been independently created no man can explain.
But why would not you let us come for you? I wish you may not repent it.
But why, in the case o distinct species, the sexual elements should so generally have become mor or less modified, leading to their mutual infertility, we do not know; bu it seems to stand in some close relation to species having been exposed fo long periods of time to nearly uniform conditions of life.
But why, on the theory of creation, they should not hav been created there, it would be very difficult to explain.
But with William and Fanny Price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and freshness, wounded by no opposition of interest, cooled by no separate attachment, and feeling the influence of time and absence only in its increase.
But with respect to Nageli's doctrine of an innat tendency towards perfection or progressive development, can it be said i the case of these strongly pronounced variations, that the plants have bee caught in the act of progressing towards a higher state of development?  O the contrary, I should infer from the mere fact of the parts in questio differing or varying greatly on the same plant, that such modification were of extremely small importance to the plants themselves, of whateve importance they may generally be to us for our classifications.
But with respect to th seeds, it seems impossible that their differences in shape, which are no always correlated with any difference in the corolla, can be in any wa beneficial; yet in the Umbelliferae these differences are of such apparen importance - the seeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flower and coelospermous in the central flowers - that the elder De Candoll founded his main divisions in the order on such characters.
But with the Alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of th returning warmth, first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of th mountains, the case will have been somewhat different; for it is not likel that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges fa distant from each other, and have survived there ever since; they wil also, in all probability, have become mingled with ancient Alpine species which must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of th Glacial epoch, and which during the coldest period will have bee temporarily driven down to the plains; they will, also, have bee subsequently exposed to somewhat different climatical influences.
But with the Government the cold fit had succeeded to the hot one; and the prisoners were brought before a jury at the assizes.
But with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly fro its parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never hav transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct t its progeny.
But with you, Fanny, there may be peace.
But yes, in the never of conversation, which means not very often, I do think it.
But you are not thinking of me.
But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she is behaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you must be important to her.
But you had better both come in with me at once and get something to eat, lest you should forget your dinner in your amusement.
But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you can and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without even asking their advice.
But you hear how garrulous I am: ask me questions, ask me questions about anything, dear guest; since I must talk, make my talk profitable to you.
But you know the whole outside was spoiled centuries ago: as to the inside, that remains in its beauty after the great clearance, which took place over a hundred years ago, of the beastly monuments to fools and knaves, which once blocked it up, as great-grandfather says.
But you like Julia best.
But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.
But you must give my compliments to him.
But you must understand therewith, that though separate households are the rule amongst us, and though they differ in their habits more or less, yet no door is shut to any good-tempered person who is content to live as the other house-mates do: only of course it would be unreasonable for one man to drop into a household and bid the folk of it to alter their habits to please him, since he can go elsewhere and live as he pleases.
But you shall come to-day, you shall do all you want; I have set my heart on spoiling you.
But you'll see it often.
But you, dear neighbour; it seems to me stranger that you should know the upper river, than that I should not know it; for, as I understand, you have only been in England a few days.
But, Crawford, though I refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend.
But, Fanny, if your heart can acquit you of ingratitude -  He ceased.
But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry.
But, a I remarked towards the close of the introduction, no one ought to fee surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained on the origin of species, i we make due allowance for our profound ignorance on the mutual relations o the inhabitants of the world at the present time, and still more so durin past ages.
But, after som preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most striking classes o facts, namely, the existence of the same species on the summits of distan mountain ranges, and at distant points in the Arctic and Antarctic regions and secondly (in the following chapter), the wide distribution of fres water productions; and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestria species on islands and on the nearest mainland, though separated b hundreds of miles of open sea.
But, alas! it was not such a home, she had not such a welcome, as - she checked herself; she was unreasonable.
But, all things considered, I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know (owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are; - on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should be a difference.
But, as Buckland long ag remarked, extinct species can all be classed either in still existin groups, or between them.
But, as I have attempted to show, weight evidence can be opposed to the admission of great and abrupt modifications.
But, as I was saying, Richard, or was about to say, my daughter has been allowed to rust; her aunt was a mere duenna; hence, in parenthesis, Richard, her distrust of me; my nature and that of the duenna are poles asunder - poles! But, now that I am here, now that I have given up the fight, and live henceforth for one only of my works - I have the modesty to say it is my best - my daughter - well, we shall put all that to rights.
But, as Mr. G.H. Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too much, for the ancien domestic races figured on the Egyptian monuments, or embalmed, are closel similar or even identical with those now living; yet all naturalists admi that such races have been produced through the modification of thei original types.
But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of th earth?  It will be more convenient to discuss this question in the chapte on the imperfection of the geological record; and I will here only stat that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably les perfect than is generally supposed.
But, as far as structure is concerned, I can see n similarity between tridactyle pedicellariae and avicularia.
But, as my great grandfather will tell you, it would not be quite a straightforward job; for there are wonderful collections in there of all kinds of antiquities, besides an enormous library with many exceedingly beautiful books in it, and many most useful ones as genuine records, texts of ancient works and the like; and the worry and anxiety, and even risk, there would be in moving all this has saved the buildings themselves.
But, as we have seen, organic beings long habituated to certain unifor conditions under a state of nature, when subjected, as under confinement to a considerable change in their conditions, very frequently are rendere more or less sterile; and we know that a cross between two forms that hav become widely or specifically different, produce hybrids which are almos always in some degree sterile.
But, at any rate, his staying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she was to remove to London, meant something that she could not bear.
But, besides such differences, al naturalists admit that natural varieties exist, which are considere sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in systematic works.
But, by G - ! if she belonged to me, I'd give her the rope's end as long as I could stand over her.
But, by steps hereafter to be explained, th larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera.
But, come, we ought to be going; for we are not half way, and we ought to be in well before sunset.
But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies.
But, dear neighbour, that is not a very effective salve for the wound caused by the 'tyranny of a majority' in our society; because all work that is done is either beneficial or hurtful to every member of society.
But, dear neighbour, there you are alone in the boat, and you have been sculling pretty hard I should think, and might find a little quiet sitting pleasant; so we had better part our company into two.
But, even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has, how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own? He took me wholly by surprise.
But, for our purpose, a form o selection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from ever one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is mor important.
But, however, I understand you to be speaking of book-learning; and as to that, it is a simple affair.
But, however, to put it in a cooler way: you expected to see children thrust into schools when they had reached an age conventionally supposed to be the due age, whatever their varying faculties and dispositions might be, and when there, with like disregard to facts to be subjected to a certain conventional course of 'learning.' My friend, can't you see that such a proceeding means ignoring the fact of growth, bodily and mental? No one could come out of such a mill uninjured; and those only would avoid being crushed by it who would have the spirit of rebellion strong in them.
But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave it.
But, if the warmth continues, probably the wind will back (shift against the sun's course) and more Southerly, or South-westerly wind will follow.
But, if we proceed from a district where one Leptali imitates an Ithomia, another mocking and mocked species, belonging to th same two genera, equally close in their resemblance, may be found.
But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly b said to have a distinct origin.
But, in general, I can assure you that they are all passed over, and all very ill used.
But, poor things! they cannot help it; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas.
But, says he, I think it would be better if I told them in the first person, as if it were myself who had gone through them; which, indeed, will be the easier and more natural to me, since I understand the feelings and desires of the comrade of whom I am telling better than any one else in the world does.
But, starting wit species already somewhat like each other, the closest resemblance, i beneficial, could readily be gained by the above means, and if the imitate form was subsequently and gradually modified through any agency, th imitating form would be led along the same track, and thus be altered t almost any extent, so that it might ultimately assume an appearance o colouring wholly unlike that of the other members of the family to which i belonged.
But, there were many angels who did not go with them, and among them one he knew.
But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit�s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.
But, what was more interesting to us, he had detailed record of the period of the change to the present state of things, and told us a great deal about it, and especially of that exodus of the people from the town to the country, and the gradual recovery by the town-bred people on one side, and the country-bred people on the other, of those arts of life which they had each lost; which loss, as he told us, had at one time gone so far that not only was it impossible to find a carpenter or a smith in a village or small country town, but that people in such places had even forgotten how to bake bread, and that at Wallingford, for instance, the bread came down with the newspapers by an early train from London, worked in some way, the explanation of which I could not understand.
By G - , I wish you may! But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he thought you would be sent first to the Texel.
By a continued process of this nature, I believe that the strang instinct of our cuckoo has been generated.
By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund's favour.
By a monstrosity  presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure, generall injurious, or not useful to the species.
By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for instance of a female-ass being first crossed by a stallion, and then a mare by  male-ass:  these two species may then be said to have been reciprocall crossed.
By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, English race horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent Arabs, so tha the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are favoured in th weights which they carry.
By a thermometer the weight of air is not shown.
By all the others it was mentioned with regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling -  from the sincerity of Edmund's too partial regard, to the unconcern of his mother speaking entirely by rote.
By all this they burdened themselves with a prodigious mass of work merely for the sake of keeping their wretched system going.
By an increas in the size of this projection, with its shape, as well as that of th terminal segment, slightly modified and improved, the pincers are rendere more and more perfect, until we have at last an instrument as efficient a the chelae of a lobster.
By attention to the following observations (the results of many years practice and many persons' experience) any one not accustomed to use  barometer may do so without difficulty.
By change in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas now continuous mus often have existed within recent times in a far less continuous and unifor condition than at present.
By comparing the account given in various old treatises of the former and present state of carrie and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India, and Persia, we can trace the stage through which they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatl from the rock-pigeon.
By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have in an country struggled successfully with the indigenes, and have there becom naturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the native would have had to be modified in order to gain an advantage over thei compatriots; and we may at least infer that diversification of structure amounting to new generic differences, would be profitable to them.
By continuing the same process for a greater number of generations (a shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner), we get eigh species, marked by the letters between a14 and m14, all descended from (A).
By convincing her that Fanny was very pretty, which she had been doubting about before, and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel a sort of credit in calling her niece.
By degrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, at first only in working and talking, but after a few days, the remembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny found it impossible not to try for books again.
By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house.
By far the greater part of these in past days were the result of the laws of private property, which forbade the satisfaction of their natural desires to all but a privileged few, and of the general visible coercion which came of those laws.
By her other aunt, Susan was received with quiet kindness.
By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct form supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered a several points low down in the series, the three existing families on th uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other.
By my theory thes allied species are descended from a common parent; and during the proces of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of it own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent-for and all the transitional varieties between its past and present states.
By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken, unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really extremely happy to see him, and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.
By one of the suffering party within they were expected with such impatience as she had never known before.
By sitting together upstairs, they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of the house; Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think it no misfortune to be quietly employed.
By such modifications o instincts which in themselves are not very wonderful - hardly more wonderfu than those which guide a bird to make its nest - I believe that the hive-be has acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectura powers.
By taking a circuitous route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable direction to the knoll, they were soon beyond her eye; and for some minutes longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion.
By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes.
By the above singular manne of building, strength is continually given to the comb, with the utmos ultimate economy of wax.
By the bye, Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out.
By the bye, I looked in upon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying not to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was with me.
By the end of eleven years, however, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her.
By the term systematic affinity is meant, the general resemblance betwee species in structure and constitution.
By the theory of natural selection all living species have been connecte with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not greater than w see between the natural and domestic varieties of the same species at th present day; and these parent-species, now generally extinct, have in thei turn been similarly connected with more ancient forms; and so on backwards always converging to the common ancestor of each great class.
By the tim that an animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepes recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterate its eyes, and natural selection will often have effected other changes such as an increase in the length of the antennae or palpi, as  compensation for blindness.
By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else.
By the time he had done winding the clock, the Clockmaker spied the caraffe; and being thirsty after last night's beer, drained it to the dregs.
By the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London; that she had sent her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having spent scarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his return from Norfolk, before he set off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town, had been in town, he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him himself, but that he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and was to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.
By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do for it.
By the time that the cold had reached its maximum, we should hav an arctic fauna and flora, covering the central parts of Europe, as fa south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and even stretching into Spain.
By the very small expense of an establishment of barometers, so placed as to be accessible to any fishermen, boatmen or others on the coasts, much loss of life, as well as loss of boats, and even shipping, might be prevented.
By their own accounts they had been all walking after each other, and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, to Fanny's observation, to have been as much too late for re-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration.
By this movement the stems are inclined to all sides, an are made to move round and round.
By this proces long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what I have calle unconscious selection by man, combined, no doubt, in a most importan manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of parts, it seem to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed quadruped might be converte into a giraffe.
By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful.
By this time they had a biggish fund of money for the support of strikes, and could stop a certain industry altogether for a time if they so determined.
By this time we were within the shop or booth, which had a counter, and shelves on the walls, all very neat, though without any pretence of showiness, but otherwise not very different to what I had been used to.
By unit of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see i organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of thei habits of life.
By what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not pretend t conjecture.
Bye, bye! Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.
C. Murray from Persia.
Call the breeds of pigeons, some of which have bred true fo centuries, species; and how exactly parallel is the case with that of th species of the horse genus!  For myself, I venture confidently to look bac thousands on thousands of generations, and I see an animal striped like  zebra, but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the commo parent of our domestic horse (whether or not it be descended from one o more wild stocks) of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.
Campbell has been here, quite in a worry about you; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you, and here everything comes upon me at once.
Can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than tha of a woodpecker for climbing trees and seizing insects in the chinks of th bark?  Yet in North America there are woodpeckers which feed largely o fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing.
Can it admit of a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does.
Can it then b thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedl occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each being in th great and complex battle of life, should occur in the course of man successive generations?  If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering tha many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individual having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the bes chance of surviving and procreating their kind?  On the other hand, we ma feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidl destroyed.
Can we consider the sting of the bee as perfect, which, whe used against many kinds of enemies, cannot be withdrawn, owing to th backward serratures, and thus inevitably causes the death of the insect b tearing out its viscera If we look at the sting of the bee, as having existed in a remot progenitor, as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so man members of the same great order, and that it has since been modified bu not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally adapte for some other object, such as to produce galls, since intensified, we ca perhaps understand how it is that the use of the sting should so ofte cause the insect's own death:  for if on the whole the power of stinging b useful to the social community, it will fulfil all the requirements o natural selection, though it may cause the death of some few members.
Cannot you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets -  starched up into seeming piety, but with heads full of something very different - especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at - and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now.
Cases can even be given of the larvae of allie species, or groups of species, differing more from each other than do th adults.
Cases of this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter see inexplicable on the theory of independent creation.
Causes of Variability  -  Effects of Habit and the use and disuse of Part  -  Correlated Variation  -  Inheritance  -  Character of Domestic Varietie  -  Difficulty of distinguishing between Varieties and Species  -  Origin o Domestic Varieties from one or more Species  -  Domestic Pigeons, thei Differences and Origin  -  Principles of Selection, anciently followed their Effects  -  Methodical and Unconscious Selection  -  Unknown Origin o our Domestic Productions  -  Circumstances favourable to Man's power o Selection.
Certain animals belonging to several classes are now known to have th power of ordinary reproduction at an unusually early age; and we have onl to accelerate parthenogenetic reproduction by gradual steps to an earlie and earlier age - Chironomus showing us an almost exactly intermediat stage, viz., that of the pupa - and we can perhaps account for th marvellous case of the Cecidomyia.
Certain compound animals, or zoophytes, as they have been termed, namel the Polyzoa, are provided with curious organs called avicularia.
Certain plants excrete sweet juice apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from the sap: this is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of the stipules i some Leguminosae, and at the backs of the leaves of the common laurel.
Certain seeds, however, were always killed by this process.
Certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states o the silk-moth; or, again, in the full-grown horns of cattle.
Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn betwee species and sub-species - that is, the forms which in the opinion of som naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at, the rank o species; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, o between lesser varieties and individual differences.
Certainly there are two kinds of whirlwinds - one caused by rarefaction tending to lighten vertical pressure under the vortex, though not perhaps, under all the current drawn towards it; and the other, a consequence of opposing winds, which occasion huge eddies or whirlwind of compression.
Certainly, my home at my uncle's brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals.
Change o climate must have had a powerful influence on migration.
Changed conditions generally induce mere fluctuatin variability, but sometimes they cause direct and definite effects; an these may become strongly marked in the course of time, though we have no sufficient evidence on this head.
Changed conditions of life are of the highest importance in causin variability, both by acting directly on the organisation, and indirectly b affecting the reproductive system.
Changed habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of th flowering of plants when transported from one climate to another.
Changes of instinct may sometimes b facilitated by the same species having different instincts at differen periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or when placed unde different circumstances, etc.; in which case either the one or the othe instinct might be preserved by natural selection.
Changes of level in the land must also have been highl influential:  a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerg it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will no blend together, or may formerly have blended.
Changes of structure at an early age may affect part subsequently developed; and many cases of correlated variation, the natur of which we are unable to understand, undoubtedly occur.
Charles Maddox was to be the man.
Charles had been born since Fanny's going away, but Tom she had often helped to nurse, and now felt a particular pleasure in seeing again.
Check these tears; they do but exhaust you.
Children of the same family, the same blood, with the same first associations and habits, have some means of enjoyment in their power, which no subsequent connexions can supply; and it must be by a long and unnatural estrangement, by a divorce which no subsequent connexion can justify, if such precious remains of the earliest attachments are ever entirely outlived.
Christmas Eve, Dick.
Cirripede afford a good instance of this:  even the illustrious Cuvier did no perceive that a barnacle was a crustacean:  but a glance at the larva show this in an unmistakable manner.
Cirripedes long appeared to me t present, under this point of view, a case of great difficulty; but I hav been enabled, by a fortunate chance, to prove that two individuals, thoug both are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.
Clara blushed and looked very happy at all this; for I think up to this time she had been rather frightened of Ellen.
Clara came out of the fields as he spoke; and with one look at Ellen I turned and went with Dick, doubting, if I must say the truth, whether I should see her again.
Clara came to have a long talk with me to-day, but Dick will serve her turn much better.
Clara listened to him with restless eyes, as if she were excited and pleased; Dick knitted his brow and looked still more uncomfortable, but said nothing.
Clara was cheerful and natural, but a little subdued, I thought; and she at least was not sorry to be gone, and often looked shyly and timidly at Ellen and her strange wild beauty.
Clara was particularly affectionate to Dick, as I noticed from the rowing thwart; but as for him, he was as frankly kind and merry as ever; and I was glad to see it, as a man of his temperament could not have taken her caresses cheerfully and without embarrassment if he had been at all entangled by the fairy of our last night's abode.
Clara's face was turned full upon me now, but she also did not seem to see me, though I know I was trying to catch her eye with an appealing look.
Clara, for instance, beautiful and bright as she was, was not unlike a very pleasant and unaffected young lady; and the other girls also seemed nothing more than specimens of very much improved types which I had known in other times.

Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of  species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to be th most effective of all checks.
Close investigation, in many cases, wil no doubt bring naturalists to agree how to rank doubtful forms.
Closely allied species, now livin on a continuous area, must often have been formed when the area was no continuous, and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduat away from one part to another.
Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from a intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character, is th fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that fossils from tw consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than ar the fossils from two remote formations.
Coarsely followed, it would have merited a name grown somewhat unfamiliar to our ears.

Come with me into the breakfast-room, we shall find everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves.
Come! Dine with us tomorrow.
Come! we must go back presently to the others.
Come, come away with me - come away from this place.
Come, do change your mind.
Come, doesn't it all look very pretty? It isn't gaudy, you know.
Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at home.
Coming as he did from such a purport fulfilled as had taken him away, he would have expected anything rather than a look of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning.
Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see th wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences i their skulls.
Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France, or o the United States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what  surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as goo species, and by another as mere varieties.
Compared with me, all the rest were blameless.
Compared with what she was now, her condition of the morning seemed positively natural.
Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world.
Connected as we already are, and, I hope, are to be, to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom, under any other distress, I should turn to for consolation.
Consequentl evidence of their former existence could be found only among fossil remains which are preserved, as we shall attempt to show in a future chapter, in a extremely imperfect and intermittent record.
Consequentl the groups which are now large, and which generally include many dominan species, tend to go on increasing in size.
Consequentl there is no reason to suppose that they have been inherited from a commo progenitor; for had this been the case they would have closely resemble each other in all respects.
Consequently each newly-formed variety would generally be at firs local, as seems to be the common rule with varieties in a state of nature so that similarly modified individuals would soon exist in a small bod together, and would often breed together.
Consequently if it were to undergo  considerable amount of modification during the deposition of any on geological formation, a section would not include all the fine intermediat gradations which must on our theory have existed, but abrupt, thoug perhaps slight, changes of form.
Consequently natural selection would have ha different materials or variations to work on, in order to arrive at th same functional result; and the structures thus acquired would almos necessarily have differed.
Consequently such parts, being already present i considerable numbers, and being highly variable, would naturally afford th materials for adaptation to the most different purposes; yet they woul generally retain, through the force of inheritance, plain traces of thei original or fundamental resemblance.
Consequently there seems at first no limit to the amount o profitable diversification of structure, and therefore no limit to th number of species which might be produced.
Consequently we have here everything favourable for much modification - fo far more modification than with the Alpine productions, left isolated within a much more recent period, on the several mountain ranges and on th arctic lands of Europe and North America.
Consequently, each new variety or species, during the progress of it formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred, and tend t exterminate them.
Consequently, formations rich in fossils and sufficientl thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, will have been forme over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only where the supply o sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserv the remains before they had time to decay.
Consequently, if the theory be true, it is indisputable that before th lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long as, o probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age to th present day; and that during these vast periods the world swarmed wit living creatures.
Consequently, in the course of many thousand generations, th most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would have the bes chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplantin the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinc from each other, take the rank of species.
Consequently, the competition between fresh water productions will hav been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowl produced, and old forms more slowly exterminated.
Consequently, whatever part of th structure of the common progenitor, or of its early descendants, becam variable; variations of this part would, it is highly probable, be take advantage of by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit the severa places in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of th same species to each other, or to fit the males to struggle with othe males for the possession of the females.
Consider the house as half your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring.

Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is an difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness, an then stopping their work.
Considering that these several means of transport, and that other means which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year afte year for tens of thousands of years, it would, I think, be a marvellou fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported.
Considering the nature of the differences between the specie in the group which includes the above Ceroxylus, there is nothin improbable in this insect having varied in the irregularities on it surface, and in these having become more or less green-coloured; for i every group the characters which differ in the several species are the mos apt to vary, while the generic characters, or those common to all th species, are the most constant.
Considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility o first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must b considered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertilit graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility unde certain conditions in excess; that their fertility, besides being eminentl susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is innatel variable; that it is by no means always the same in degree in the firs cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross; that the fertility o hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in externa appearance either parent; and lastly, that the facility of making a firs cross between any two species is not always governed by their systemati affinity or degree of resemblance to each other.
Constancy: I am not afraid of the word.
Contrast is necessary for this explanation.
Conversation with any of them occupied but a small part of it.
Cooled by evaporation as much as the state of the air admits - the moist (or wet) bulb thermometer shows temperature nearly equal to that of the other one, when the atmosphere is extremely damp, or moist; but lower at other times, - in proportion to the dryness of air, and consequent evaporation, as far as twelve of fifteen degrees in this climate; twenty or even more elsewhere.
Cottager's wife is a very pretty part, I assure you.
Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not have been wanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power.
Could I immediately apply to either, however, I should still prefer you, because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up, as to shut their eyes to the truth.
Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece's feelings, when she wrote her first letter to her aunt, he would not have despaired; for though a good night's rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William again, and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and Charles being gone to school, Sam on some project of his own, and her father on his usual lounges, enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home, there were still, to her own perfect consciousness, many drawbacks suppressed.
Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable woman's affections, could he have found sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance, in working himself into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price, there would have been every probability of success and felicity for him.
Could he have seen only half that she felt before the end of a week, he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of her, and been delighted with his own sagacity.
Could it be possible? Edmund so inconsistent! Was he not deceiving himself? Was he not wrong? Alas! it was all Miss Crawford's doing.
Could she be detached from them! -  and sometimes I do not despair of it, for the affection appears to me principally on their side.
Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him, it would be - oh, how different would it be -  how far more tolerable! But he was deceived in her: he gave her merits which she had not; her faults were what they had ever been, but he saw them no longer.
Could they be much together, I feel sure of their liking each other.
Could we be all assembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.
Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund's return, Sir Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it was really a necessary compliment.
Crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but he could have wished her sister away.
Crawford had been too precipitate.
Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me, but I found it impossible to write from London, and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence.
Crawford took the volume.
Crawford was excessively pleased.
Crawford's is no common attachment; he perseveres, with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before.
Crawford, delighted to get her to speak at any rate, was determined to keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to silence him by such an extremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was only a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another.
Curiosity and vanity were both engaged, and the temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to make any sacrifice to right: he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey, resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it, or that its purpose was unimportant, and staid.
Cuvier ranked the Ruminants and Pachyderms as two of th most distinct orders of mammals; but so many fossil links have bee disentombed that Owen has had to alter the whole classification, and ha placed certain Pachyderms in the same sub-order with ruminants; fo example, he dissolves by gradations the apparently wide interval betwee the pig and the camel.
Cuvier use to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinc species have been discovered in India, South America and in Europe, as fa back as the miocene stage.
Cyclonology, or really meteorology, is simple enough in these great characteristic effects; but their causes must be the philosopher' study, rather than that of the young practical seaman.
Dalton, likewise, in Pander an Dalton's work on Fossil Sloths, expressed, in 1821, a similar belief.
Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it.
De Candolle ha remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open;  should explain this rule by the impossibility of seeds gradually becomin winged through natural selection, unless the capsules were open; for i this case alone could the seeds, which were a little better adapted to b wafted by the wind, gain an advantage over others less well fitted for wid dispersal.
De Candolle has observed, a commo alpine species disappears.
De Candolle then goes on to say that h gives the rank of species to the forms that differ by characters neve varying on the same tree, and never found connected by intermediate states.
Dear Fanny, write directly, and tell us to come.
Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done it, on any account.
Dear me! thought I, how apt history is to reverse contemporary judgments.
Decidedly.
Deep lanes were mowed amidst the thick crowd; the dead and dying covered the ground, and the shrieks and wails and cries of horror filled all the air, till it seemed as if there were nothing else in the world but murder and death.
Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray such a preference of her uncle's house.
Denial was impossible.

Depend upon it, there is some mistake, and that a day or two will clear it up; at any rate, that Henry is blameless, and in spite of a moment's etourderie, thinks of nobody but you.
Depend upon it, you see but half.

Dick (who, in spite of Clara's gibe, knew the place very well) told me that the beautiful old Tudor rooms, which I remembered had been the dwellings of the lesser fry of Court flunkies, were now much used by people coming and going; for, beautiful as architecture had now become, and although the whole face of the country had quite recovered its beauty, there was still a sort of tradition of pleasure and beauty which clung to that group of buildings, and people thought going to Hampton Court a necessary summer outing, as they did in the days when London was so grimy and miserable.
Dick and his father were henceforth on terms of coldness.
Dick answered her with some lover's speech, impossible to be written down, and then we sat quiet a little.
Dick asked himself with concern whether she were altogether in her right wits.
Dick brought me at once into the little field which, as I had seen from the garden, was covered with gaily-coloured tents arranged in orderly lanes, about which were sitting and lying on the grass some fifty or sixty men, women, and children, all of them in the height of good temper and enjoyment - with their holiday mood on, so to say.
Dick came up to his table and inquired if he might look at what the gentleman was doing.
Dick consented.
Dick could not sufficiently congratulate himself on the escape he had effected.
Dick explained to me that there were scattered houses in the forest, and indeed we caught a glimpse of one or two.
Dick found him one day at the receipt of custom, rapidly painting a pair of hens and a cock in a little water-colour sketching box, and now and then glancing at the ceiling like a man who should seek inspiration from the muse.
Dick got very much excited now, and often stood up in the boat to cry out to us that this was such and such a field, and so forth; and we caught fire at his enthusiasm for the hay-field and its harvest, and pulled our best.
Dick had a respect for his father as the best of men, tempered by the politic revolt of a youth who has to see to his own independence.
Dick had never found any one take a fancy to him so readily, nor show it in an easier or less offensive manner.
Dick laughed.
Dick lay on his oars, and we followed his example.
Dick looked at her hard, and half reached out his hand toward her, and his whole face quivered with emotion.
Dick looked at him with some wonder.
Dick moved on a little without a word to me.
Dick nodded smilingly, and the old man and I were soon alone in the great hall, the afternoon sun gleaming on the red wine in our tall quaint-shaped glasses.
Dick paused for an instant on the threshold of the platform.
Dick protested, but in vain.
Dick remained as she had left him, standing squarely upon one foot and resting only on the toe of the other, and as he stood he listened with his soul.
Dick rose in the boat and cried out a genial good morrow; I tried to be as genial as Dick, but failed; Clara waved a delicate hand to her; and Morsom nodded and looked on with interest.
Dick said it was.
Dick seemed roused, and even angry.
Dick she motioned sharply towards the door, and he could only obey her.
Dick stood aghast.
Dick stood looking at him in a maze.
Dick thought it remarkable that a painter should choose to work over an absinthe in a public caf�, and looked the man over.
Dick took her in his arms, and their lips were set together for a long while.
Dick used to wax indignant, and none the less so because, as his father was a skilful disputant, he found himself not seldom in the wrong.
Dick was clearly kicking him underneath the table; but he was not much abashed, and awaited my answer somewhat eagerly.
Dick was confounded; he recovered from astonishment only to fall into doubt and alarm.
Dick was left hobbled by the canvas, and was subjected to Van Tromp for about an hour.
Dick was left once more alone to darkness and to that dulled and dogged state of mind when a man thinks that misery must now have done her worst, and is almost glad to think so.
Dick was put to this menial task forthwith, the Admiral not even watching how he did, but quite occupied with another grog and a pleasant vein of talk.
Dick wondered who paid for these excursions, and at the thought that the reprobate must get his pocket money where he got his board and lodging, from poor Esther's generosity, he had it almost in his heart to knock the old gentleman down.
Dick would have retreated, in the panic terror of the moment; but Esther kept a bright look-out when her lover was expected.
Dick's friend looked to be a man of about forty; tall, black-haired, very kind-looking and thoughtful; but rather to my surprise there was a shade of melancholy on his face, and he seemed a little abstracted and inattentive to our chat, in spite of obvious efforts to listen.
Dick's heart had grown as cold as ice.
Dick's shirt was wet; he made a lumbering excuse to go; which Esther explained to herself by a fear of intrusion, and so set down to the merit side of Dick's account, while she proceeded to detain him.
Dick's solicitude was nipped and frosted.
Dick, on his part, was as white as a sheet; his eyes burned and his lips trembled with anger as he thrust the door suddenly open, introduced Esther with ceremonious gallantry, and stood forward and knocked his hat firmer on his head like a man about to leap.
Dick, standing by me was looking round the company with an air of proprietorship in them, I thought.
Dick, who had heard nothing of the matter, was up first on that inauspicious day, and took the journal to an arbour in the garden.
Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? I am stupefied.
Did a Clockmaker exist, it was not to be supposed he could suffer these expressions to pass unpunished; it was to be feared the whole caraffe might be involved in his revenge.
Differences in the larva might, also become correlated with successive stages of its development; so that th larva, in the first stage, might come to differ greatly from the larva i the second stage, as is the case with many animals.
Difficult as it is to foretell weather accurately, much useful foresight may be acquired by combining the indications of instruments such as the barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer with atmospheric appearances.

Dinner over, we sauntered through the ancient rooms, where the pictures and tapestry were still preserved, and nothing was much changed, except that the people whom we met there had an indefinable kind of look of being at home and at ease, which communicated itself to me, so that I felt that the beautiful old place was mine in the best sense of the word; and my pleasure of past days seemed to add itself to that of to-day, and filled my whole soul with content.
Dinner passed heavily.
Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles' drive home allowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a few pheasants' eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the way.

Do you find them agreeable acquaintance? Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he being entirely without particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love or acting, could speak very handsomely of both.
Do you know, she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing.
Do you mean the tide? If so, it is close on the turn now.
Do you remember it? I came to rehearse.
Do you think I cannot enjoy your pleasures? Esther, I do.
Do you think, if you can tell it to me, and I understand at once, that it would be more difficult to tell it to your own father, or that he would not be more ready to sympathise with you than I am? And I love you, Dick; but then he is your father.
Do you wonder at it? In times past, indeed, men were told to love their kind, to believe in the religion of humanity, and so forth.
Does it not strike you so, Fanny? You hesitate.
Does the barometer show a sudden change of wind as well as the coming on of bad weather?
Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have becom inherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this is no true.
Domestic instincts, a they may be called, are certainly far less fixed than natural instincts but they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have bee transmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed condition of life.
Domestic races often have a somewha monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from eac other and from other species of the same genus, in several triflin respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, bot when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with th species under nature to which they are nearest allied.
Domesticated productions, on th other hand, which, as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, wer not originally highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, an which can now generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated change of conditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which would b little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by th act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like manner.
Dominant species belonging to the larger groups within each class tend t give birth to new and dominant forms; so that each large group tends t become still larger, and at the same time more divergent in character.

Don't you think he will look younger after a little time with us? The old man shook his head, and looked earnestly at me, but did not answer her, and for a moment or two we were all silent.
Doubtless this would have happened if it had not been that the huge mass had been leavened by Socialist opinion in the first place, and in the second by actual contact with declared Socialists, many or indeed most of whom were members of those bodies of workmen above said.
Down I went on to it, and sure enough among the empty boats moored to it lay a man on his sculls in a solid-looking tub of a boat clearly meant for bathers.
Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.
Down on the green lip of the river, just where the water turns toward the Goring and Streatley reaches, were half a dozen girls playing about on the grass.
Dr. Cruge sent me a flower in spirits of wine, with a bee which he had killed befor it had quite crawled out, with a pollen-mass still fastened to its back.
Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had begun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.
Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon.
Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no disinclination to the state herself.
Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as they stopt to speak to him she found, from Edmund's manner, that he did mean to go with her.
Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which he had little credit with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his wife.
Dr. Grant, through an interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes, succeeded to a stall in Westminster, which, as affording an occasion for leaving Mansfield, an excuse for residence in London, and an increase of income to answer the expenses of the change, was highly acceptable to those who went and those who staid.
Dr. Hooker has als lately shown that several of the plants living on the upper parts of th lofty island of Fernando Po, and on the neighbouring Cameroon Mountains, i the Gulf of Guinea, are closely related to those on the mountains o Abyssinia, and likewise to those of temperate Europe.
Dr. Hooker has recently shown that in the southeas corner of Australia, where, apparently, there are many invaders fro different quarters of the globe, the endemic Australian species have bee greatly reduced in number.
Dr. Hooker informs me tha twenty-five species of Algae are common to New Zealand and to Europe, bu have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas.
Dr. Hooker permits me to ad that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined the tables, h thinks that the following statements are fairly well established.
Dr. Prosper Lucas' treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the bes on this subject.
Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father.
Draw a circle; mark the direction of the rotation or circulation, by an arrow with the head towards the left hand (against the movement of a watch's hands) in North latitude; but towards the right (or with the hands of a watch) if in South latitude.

Drift timber i thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest oceans and the natives of the coral islands in the Pacific procure stones fo their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these stones being  valuable royal tax.
Due allowance, therefore, should be made in observing, when on high land.
During carriage, it ought to be kept with the cistern end uppermost, or lying flat, the former position being preferable.
During early youth however, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is the symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured.
During periods of elevation th area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will b increased and new stations will often be formed - all circumstance favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties an species; but during such periods there will generally be a blank in th geological record.
During th convalescence of animals, great benefit is derived from almost any chang in their habits of life.
During the Glacial period, when the inhabitants of the Old and New World lived further southwards than they do at present, they must have been stil more completely separated from each other by wider spaces of ocean; so tha it may well be asked how the same species could then or previously hav entered the two continents.
During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary leve the record will generally be blank.
During the last few days there had been groups of men parading the streets asking (or, if you please, demanding) money to buy food; and what for goodwill, what for fear, the richer people gave them a good deal.
During the months of June an July, on three successive years, I watched for many hours several nests i Surrey and Sussex, and never saw a slave either leave or enter a nest.
During the periods of subsidence, there would probably be much extinctio of life; during the periods of elevation, there would be much variation but the geological record would then be less perfect.
During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as th species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated sout of the Polar Circle, they will have been completely cut off from eac other.
During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits.
During the year 1860, however, in the month of July, I cam across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves, and I observe a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest, and marchin along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir tree, twenty-five yards distant which they ascended together, probably in search of aphides or cocci.
During these latter periods there wil probably be more variability in the forms of life; during periods o subsidence, more extinction.
During these long and blank intervals I suppos that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount o modification and extinction, and that there was much migration from othe parts of the world.
During this length of time the shell might have bee carried by a marine country of average swiftness to a distance of 66 geographical miles.
During this, the coldest period, the lowlands under the equator must hav been clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like tha described by Hooker as growing luxuriantly at the height of from four t five thousand feet on the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps  still greater preponderance of temperate forms.
During two or three days they slowly careered round and round in an immens ellipse, at least five or six miles in diameter, and at night alighted o the taller trees, which were completely coated with them.
Eac formation, on this view, does not mark a new and complete act of creation but only an occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in an ever slowl changing drama.
Each house stood in a garden carefully cultivated, and running over with flowers.
Each man is free to exercise his special faculty to the utmost, and every one encourages him in so doing.
Each new form also, as soon as it has been much improved, will be able to spread over th open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with man other forms.
Each of the endless variations which w see in the plumage of our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and i the same cause were to act uniformly during a long series of generations o many individuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner.
Each sister believed herself the favourite.
Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the best claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the rest.
Each was thoughtful.
Each word of the slowly-changing language, more o less different in the successive chapters, may represent the forms of life which are entombed in our consecutive formations, and which falsely appea to have been abruptly introduced.
Earth, air and water, each seemed in better health and had more of the shrewd salt of life in them than upon ordinary mornings; and from east to west, from the lowest glen to the height of heaven, from every look and touch and scent, a human creature could gather the most encouraging intelligence as to the durability and spirit of the universe.
Easter came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most sorrowfully considered, on first learning that she had no chance of leaving Portsmouth till after it.
Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements and dresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his never-failing subject, and to boast of the past his only consolation.
Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and she was excluded.
Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing but what was right.
Edmund could not answer him.
Edmund could not but agree to it.
Edmund could not help noticing their apparently deep tranquillity.
Edmund could not share it.
Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his father a little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could produce any.
Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father's feelings, nor could he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants.
Edmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination; and upon this being understood, he had a variety of questions from Crawford as to his feelings and success; questions, which being made, though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without any touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to be most offensive to Fanny, he had true pleasure in satisfying; and when Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which particular passages in the service should be delivered, shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before, and thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and more pleased.
Edmund had descended from that moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they were both as much the better as the happier for the descent.
Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not; and that if she did not lead the way, it should never be touched on by him; but after a day or two of mutual reserve, he was induced by his father to change his mind, and try what his influence might do for his friend.
Edmund had great things to hear on his return.
Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect.
Edmund had many.
Edmund had not yet spoken.
Edmund knocked at her door in his way to his own.
Edmund laughed.
Edmund left the seat likewise.
Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny's comfort, and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all the young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion.
Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.
Edmund might still look grave, and say he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play in particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only.
Edmund might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he might read prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might ride over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through divine service; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day, for three or four hours, if that would content him.
Edmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny could tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments, and he was satisfied.
Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady, not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them.
Edmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy in the prospect of hearing her play.
Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table, on which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part.
Edmund said no more.
Edmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined not to see it, as to make it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of the protestation; and such a quick consciousness of compliment, such a ready comprehension of a hint, he thought, was rather favourable than not.
Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face, and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again, except as it might be connected with what must be agreeable to her.
Edmund smiled and shook his head.
Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist, and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin's care, but with great regret that she was not stronger.
Edmund was absent at this time, or the evil would have been earlier remedied.
Edmund was all in all.
Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having comfort from either, was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom, in the blindness of her anger, she could have charged as the daemon of the piece.
Edmund was at the Parsonage every day, to be indulged with his favourite instrument: one morning secured an invitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.
Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at hand, which were to fix his fate in life - ordination and matrimony - events of such a serious character as to make the ball, which would be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in his eyes than in those of any other person in the house.
Edmund was close to her; he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach.
Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him, lest it should appear like ill-nature.
Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who might speak and hear.
Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he wanted to know Fanny's feelings.
Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much disposed to admire, speak so freely of her uncle.
Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the business; but no representation of his aunt's could induce him to find Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion.
Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endure on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten.
Edmund watched the progress of her attention, and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework, which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford - fixed on him for minutes, fixed on him, in short, till the attraction drew Crawford's upon her, and the book was closed, and the charm was broken.
Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it seemed, under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she suspected, was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon.
Edmund's account of Fanny's disposition he could believe to be just; he supposed she had all those feelings, but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she had; for, less willing than his son to trust to the future, he could not help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were necessary for her, she might not have persuaded herself into receiving his addresses properly before the young man's inclination for paying them were over.
Edmund's deep sighs often reached Fanny.
Edmund's feelings were for the other two.
Edmund's first object the next morning was to see his father alone, and give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his own share in it as far only as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel his motives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that his concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful.
Edmund's friendship never failed her: his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them.
Edmund's letter had this postscript.
Edmund's plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey, this absence of Fanny's.
Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak as much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could desire.
Edmund, am I saying too much? Edmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on; but, on understanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.
Edmund, between his theatrical and his real part, between Miss Crawford's claims and his own conduct, between love and consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company, superintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for which nobody thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for watching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.
Edmund, too - to be two months from him (and perhaps she might be allowed to make her absence three) must do her good.
Edmund, who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before either Fanny or the steady old coachman, who always attended her when she rode without her cousins, were ready to set forward.
Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles Anderson.
Edward Forbe insisted that all the islands in the Atlantic must have been recentl connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe likewise with America.

Eggs or very young animals seem generally t suffer most, but this is not invariably the case.
Either his going had been again delayed, or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone, or he was too happy for letter-writing One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield, a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day, as she and Susan were preparing to remove, as usual, upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they felt they could not avoid, from Rebecca's alertness in going to the door, a duty which always interested her beyond any other.
Either, first, that all the severa imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock-pigeon although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked, so that i each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very sam colours and markings.
Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn�t ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone - too nervous to bear witnesses - to take the pudding up and bring it in.
Ellen and I were once more together in her boat, though Dick, for fairness' sake, was for having me in his, and letting the two women scull the green toy.
Ellen laughed heartily.
Ellen leaned back in the stern and seemed to enjoy herself thoroughly.
Ellen seemed delighted with my pleasure at this, that, or the other piece of carefulness in dealing with the river: the nursing of pretty corners; the ingenuity in dealing with difficulties of water-engineering, so that the most obviously useful works looked beautiful and natural also.
Ellen, however, would not allow this, but claimed me as the interesting person of the company.
Ellen, to my disappointment, was not amongst them, but presently I saw a light figure come out of the hay-field higher up the slope, and make for our house; and that was Ellen, holding a basket in her hand.
Embryolog will often reveal to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of th prototypes of each great class.
Embryologica resemblances of all kinds can be accounted for, as we shall hereafter see by the progenitors of our existing species having varied after early youth and having transmitted their newly-acquired characters to their offspring at a corresponding age.
Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we look at the embry as a picture, more or less obscured, of the progenitor, either in its adul or larval state, of all the members of the same great class.
Employment, even melancholy, may dispel melancholy, and her occupations were hopeful.

England was once a country of clearings amongst the woods and wastes, with a few towns interspersed, which were fortresses for the feudal army, markets for the folk, gathering places for the craftsmen.
Entirely against his judgment, a scene-painter arrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase of the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their proceedings; and his brother, instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of the representation, was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way.
Entreaty should be from one quarter only.
Equally formed for domestic life, and attached to country pleasures, their home was the home of affection and comfort; and to complete the picture of good, the acquisition of Mansfield living, by the death of Dr. Grant, occurred just after they had been married long enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feel their distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience.
Equally, if no one backs the proposer, - 'seconds him,' it used to be called - the matter drops for the time being; a thing not likely to happen amongst reasonable men, however, as the proposer is sure to have talked it over with others before the Mote.
Ere he left Paris Van Tromp was one of those whom he entertained to a farewell supper; and the old gentleman made the speech of the evening, and then fell below the table, weeping, smiling, paralysed.
Errati boulders have, also, been noticed on the Rocky Mountains.
Esther found herself at variance with her sweetest friend; she could no longer look into his heart and find it written with the same language as her own; she could no longer think of him as the sun which radiated happiness upon her life, for she had turned to him once, and he had breathed upon her black and chilly, radiated blackness and frost.
Esther had kept ahead all the way, and Dick plodded obediently in her wake; but as they neared the stables, he pushed on and took the lead.
Esther had not made a sign throughout the interview, and still kept silence now that it was over; but the Admiral, who had once or twice moved forward and drawn back again, now advanced for good.
Esther made a movement towards the door, but long before she reached it she had broken forth sobbing.
Esther obeyed.
Esther recognised him at once; she had often seen him before, though with her huge indifference for all that lay outside the circle of her love, she had never so much as wondered who he was; but now she recognised him, and found him ten years older, leaden and springless, and stamped by an abiding sorrow.
Esther returned with the tea-things, and sat down.
Esther sat upright at the table, her head resting on her hand, her eyes fixed upon the candle.
Esther stood bolt upright and looked steadily at some chickens in the corner of the yard.
Esther took as little notice of him as might be.
Esther was sitting on a stool beside her father's feet, holding her knees in her arms, and looking with pride from one to the other of her two visitors.
Esther, at this moment, re-entered the room.
Esther, passive as ever, was helped out and crossed the garden with a slow and mechanical gait; and Dick, following close behind her, heard from within the cottage his father's voice upraised in an anathema, and the shriller tones of the Admiral responding in the key of war.
Esther, whose eyes had come alive and her cheeks flushed during these last words, relapsed in a second into a state of petrifaction.
Evaporation.
Eve throughout the extensive and shallow seas within the archipelago sedimentary beds could hardly be accumulated of great thickness during th periods of elevation, or become capped and protected by subsequen deposits, so as to have a good chance of enduring to a very distant future.
Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister, and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes one feel there is attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers.
Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan, and had it at her tongue's end, and was on the point of proposing it, when Mrs. Grant spoke.
Even I am sorry for him, and he has been the loss of all I cared for.
Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally regarded a varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists.
Even a the present day, looking to members of the same class, naturalists are no unanimous which forms ought to be ranked as highest:  thus, some look a the selaceans or sharks, from their approach in some important points o structure to reptiles, as the highest fish; others look at the teleostean as the highest.
Even animals, birds, and insects have a presaging instinct, perhaps a bodily feeling, that warns them.
Even as long ago as 1747, such facts le Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been independentl created at many distinct points; and we might have remained in this sam belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid attention to the Glacia period, which, as we shall immediately see, affords a simple explanation o these facts.
Even at first sight it was a gay little craft indeed - bright green, and painted over with elegantly drawn flowers.
Even at present, by comparing the differences between th inhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the natur of the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparen means of immigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.
Even at this day, if the Mala Archipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the India Ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any grea group of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would remai confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, an were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or Australia, and thu reach other and distant seas.
Even different varieties of the pear take wit different degrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties o the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum.
Even his eyes, despairing of encouragement, ceased to attend on hers.
Even i the fitting variations did arise, it does not follow that natural selectio would be able to act on them and produce a structure which apparently woul be beneficial to the species.
Even if th few fossil species which are common to the Old and New Worlds were kep wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the successive forms o life, in the palaeozoic and tertiary stages, would still be manifest, an the several formations could be easily correlated.
Even if these take place only at long intervals of time, the youn thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offsprin from long-continued self-fertilisation, that they will have a better chanc of surviving and propagating their kind; and thus in the long run th influence of crosses, even at rare intervals, will be great.
Even in groups, in which the adults have bee modified to an extreme degree, community of origin is often revealed by th structure of the larvae; we have seen, for instance, that cirripedes though externally so like shell-fish, are at once known by their larvae t belong to the great class of crustaceans.
Even in ordinary changes of weather it is interesting, as well as useful, to mark the formation or disappearance of clouds, caused by colder and warmer currents of air mixing: or intermingling.
Even in so short an interval as that betwee the first and second editions of Pictet's great work on Palaeontology published in 1844-46 and in 1853-57, the conclusions on the firs appearance and disappearance of several groups of animals have bee considerably modified; and a third edition would require still furthe changes.
Even in such trifling characters as th colouring, the harsh tone of the voice, and undulatory flight, its clos blood-relationship to our common woodpecker is plainly declared; yet, as  can assert, not only from my own observations, but from those of th accurate Azara, in certain large districts it does not climb trees, and i makes its nest in holes in banks!  In certain other districts, however this same woodpecker, as Mr. Hudson states, frequents trees, and bore holes in the trunk for its nest.
Even in th case of the breeds of the domestic dog throughout the world, which I admi are descended from several wild species, it cannot be doubted that ther has been an immense amount of inherited variation; for who will believ that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, th bull-dog, pug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.
Even in the midst of his late infatuation, he had acknowledged Fanny's mental superiority.
Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round  growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding in positio to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells.
Even in the same sub-breed, as in that of the short-face tumbler, it is notoriously difficult to breed nearly perfect birds, man departing widely from the standard.
Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten.
Even in thi case, how small would be the chance of a seed falling on favourable soil and coming to maturity!  But it would be a great error to argue tha because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has not, as far as i known (and it would be very difficult to prove this), received within th last few centuries, through occasional means of transport, immigrants fro Europe or any other continent, that a poorly-stocked island, thoug standing more remote from the mainland, would not receive colonists b similar means.
Even now, she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June; but June is at a great distance, and I believe I shall write to her.
Even o a wide area, which has during a long period remained continuous, and o which the climatic and other conditions of life change insensibly i proceeding from a district occupied by one species into another distric occupied by a closely allied species, we have no just right to expect ofte to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zones.
Even slow-breeding man ha doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than a thousan years, there would literally not be standing room for his progeny.
Even strongly-marked difference occasionally appear in the young of the same litter, and in seedlings fro the same seed-capsule.
Even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner showing that the action was instinctive, and not the result of experience.
Even the uniform county of Cambridg has 847 plants, and the little island of Anglesea 764, but a few ferns an a few introduced plants are included in these numbers, and the compariso in some other respects is not quite fair.
Even the wide interval between birds and reptiles has been shown by th naturalist just quoted to be partially bridged over in the most unexpecte manner, on the one hand, by the ostrich and extinct Archeopteryx, and o the other hand by the Compsognathus, one of the Dinosaurians - that grou which includes the most gigantic of all terrestrial reptiles.
Even their mother missed them; and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about the house, and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of affectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve Fanny's consequence increased on the departure of her cousins.
Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality.
Even to see Mr. Crawford would be less overpowering.
Even when climate, fo instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it will be the least vigorou individuals, or those which have got least food through the advancin winter, which will suffer the most.
Even when selection has been applied by man to some on character alone - of which our cultivated plants offer the best instances - it will invariably be found that although this one part, whether it be th flower, fruit, or leaves, has been greatly changed, almost all the othe parts have been slightly modified.
Even with animals which unite for each birth, and which do not propagat rapidly, we must not assume that free intercrossing would always eliminat the effects of natural selection; for I can bring forward a considerabl body of facts showing that within the same area two varieties of the sam animal may long remain distinct, from haunting different stations, fro breeding at slightly different seasons, or from the individuals of eac variety preferring to pair together.
Even withi the limits of the same genus, we meet with this same difference; fo instance, the many species of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed tha the species of almost any other genus; but Gartner found that N. acuminata which is not a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed t fertilise, or to be fertilised, by no less than eight other species o Nicotiana.
Even within the limits of th same genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two opposite cases occur.
Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on whic our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursu certain kinds of prey.
Even your constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change.
Everingham could not do without him in the beginning of September.
Every afternoon brought a return of their riotous games all over the house; and she very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday's constant half-holiday.
Every allowance will be made for you.
Every being, which during its natura lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction durin some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers woul quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support th product.
Every feeling of duty, honour, and tenderness was wounded by her sister's speech and her mother's reply.
Every flattering scheme of being of consequence to her soon fell to the ground.
Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure t wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a multitude of flower have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather!  If a occasional cross be indispensable, notwithstanding that the plant's ow anthers and pistil stand so near each other as almost to ensure self fertilisation, the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from anothe individual will explain the above state of exposure of the organs.
Every long line cut on the vernier corresponds to .01 part; each small division on the scale is .05; the hundredth parts on the vernier being added to the five when its lower edge is next above one of the short lines; or written down as shown by the figures on the vernier only, when next above one of the division marking tenths.
Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's night.
Every on must have heard of cases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc.

Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free.
Every other child must be racking his heart.
Every public place was new to Maria, and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer.
Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own.
Every room on the west front looked across a lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron palisades and gates.
Every selected character is fully exercised by her, as i implied by the fact of their selection.
Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon, Miss Crawford, except riding.
Everybody around her was gay and busy, prosperous and important; each had their object of interest, their part, their dress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were finding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in the playful conceits they suggested.
Everybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without having much to say, which will include a large proportion of the female world at least, must feel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having such a capital piece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath, occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it, and will admit that it must have been very mortifying to her to see it fall to the share of her thankless son, and treated as concisely as possible at the end of a long letter, instead of having it to spread over the largest part of a page of her own.
Everybody began to have their vexation.
Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.
Everybody felt it.
Everybody gets made but me.
Everybody had a part either too long or too short; nobody would attend as they ought; nobody would remember on which side they were to come in; nobody but the complainer would observe any directions.
Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family.
Everybody is taken in at some period or other.
Everybody likes to go their own way - to chuse their own time and manner of devotion.
Everybody said so.
Everybody was growing weary of indecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had been proposed before so likely to suit them all.
Everybody was satisfied; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart, while the others prepared to begin.
Everyone is familia with the difference between the ray and central florets of, for instance the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the partial o complete abortion of the reproductive organs.
Everyone who believes in slow and gradual evolution, will of course admi that specific changes may have been as abrupt and as great as any singl variation which we meet with under nature, or even under domestication.
Everything answered; it was all gaiety and good-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure -  till the fourth day, when the happiness of one of the party was exceedingly clouded.
Everything in that quarter failed her, except William's affection.
Everything might be possible rather than serious attachment, or serious approbation of it toward her.
Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against it; all their habits and ways of thinking, and all her own demerits.
Everything returned into the same channel as before his absence; his manners being to each so animated and agreeable as to lose no ground with either, and just stopping short of the consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which might excite general notice.
Everything shall take its course.
Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William's mind, and he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher-toned subjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in praise of the Thrush, conjectures how she would be employed, schemes for an action with some superior force, which (supposing the first lieutenant out of the way, and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant) was to give himself the next step as soon as possible, or speculations upon prize-money, which was to be generously distributed at home, with only the reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable, in which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life together.
Everything that a considerate parent ought to feel was advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate mother must feel in promoting her children's enjoyment was attributed to her nature.
Everything was a friend, or bore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much of suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood, her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt Bertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and her friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had told her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, so harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.
Everything was by that time public beyond a hope.
Everything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and dresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great impediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost too much for her at first.
Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement received with grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.
Everything where she now was in full contrast to it.
Everywhere there was but little furniture, and that only the most necessary, and of the simplest forms.
Exactly what you deserve.
Except by assigning such general and vague reasons, we canno explain why, in many quarters of the world, hoofed quadrupeds have no acquired much elongated necks or other means for browsing on the highe branches of trees.
Except to the attack on Nanny's cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any objection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled, and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed.
Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or unlooked-for instance of Edmund's consideration of her in the last few months had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life, as in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and friend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes and fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of, dearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give her direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers and sisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all the comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield; ready to think of every member of that home as she directed, or differing only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of their aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the whole) all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over again, and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection.
Exceptions to these rules occur when a North-easterly wind, with wet (rain or snow) is impending, before which the barometer often rises (on account of the direction of the coming wind alone), and deceive persons who, from that sign only, expect fair weather.
Excluding such cases of abrupt variations, the few whic remain would at best constitute, if found in a state of nature, doubtfu species, closely related to their parental types.
Exclusive of local land and sea breezes of hot climates.
Excuse the liberty; but take care how you talk to me.
Expect the first tomorrow, when the bell tolls one.
Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced, and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford's nature that participation of the general nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own.
Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman classica writers.
Expressions such as that famous one b Linnaeus, which we often meet with in a more or less concealed form namely, that the characters do not make the genus, but that the genus give the characters, seem to imply that some deeper bond is included in ou classifications than mere resemblance.
External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge.
Extinc and ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of the mor recent animals belonging to the same classes, and this wonderful fac receives a simple explanation according to our views.
Extinct forms are seldom directl intermediate between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a lon and circuitous course through other extinct and different forms.
Extinction has only defined th groups:  it has by no means made them; for if every form which has eve lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it would be quit impossible to give definitions by which each group could be distinguished still a natural classification, or at least a natural arrangement, would b possible.
Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an importan part in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups i each class.
Eyes of the above simple nature are not capabl of distinct vision, and serve only to distinguish light from darkness.
Facility of immigration seems to have been fully as important a the nature of the conditions.
Facts, such as these, admit of no sort o explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas, on th view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would b likely to receive colonists from America, whether by occasional means o transport or (though I do not believe in this doctrine) by formerl continuous land, and the Cape Verde Islands from Africa; such colonist would be liable to modification - the principle of inheritance stil betraying their original birthplace.
Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, for an existin crocodile is associated with many lost mammals and reptiles in th sub-Himalayan deposits.
Familiar as the practical use of weather-glasses is, at sea as well a on land, only those who have long watched their indications, an compared them carefully, are really able to conclude more than that the rising glass.
Familiarity alon prevents our seeing how largely and how permanently the minds of ou domestic animals have been modified.
Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears.
Fanciers selec their dogs, horses, pigeons, etc., for breeding, when nearly grown up.
Fancy people not liking to work! - it's too ridiculous.
Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might not be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least, nothing to disgust her relations.
Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That Mansfield should have done so much for - that you should have found your fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have chosen better.
Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point: she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to refrain from wearing it.
Fanny answered for their having breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour.
Fanny began to dread the meeting with her aunts and Tom, under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel with some anxiety, that all her best manners, all her lately acquired knowledge of what was practised here, was on the point of being called into action.
Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure to her to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the first act, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria.
Fanny believed there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them; and she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford's future improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking that if Edmund's influence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing her judgment, and regulating her notions, his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony.
Fanny coloured, and said nothing.
Fanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer, or have refrained from at least trying to get away in spite of all the too public opposition she foresaw to it, had it not been for the sound of approaching relief, the very sound which she had been long watching for, and long thinking strangely delayed.
Fanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing, and leave untouched all Miss Crawford's resources -  her accomplishments, her spirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome.
Fanny could listen no farther.
Fanny could not answer him.
Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say.
Fanny could not look at him, but there was no consciousness of past folly in his voice.
Fanny could not say she did not; and as they all persevered, as Edmund repeated his wish, and with a look of even fond dependence on her good-nature, she must yield.
Fanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak.
Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning; she would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when the evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home, while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she thought it a very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her, would rather go without it than not.
Fanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught nothing more; and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar, they thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing-room.
Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for.
Fanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with renewed but less happy thanks accepted the necklace again, for there was an expression in Miss Crawford's eyes which she could not be satisfied with.
Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work, and wishing she could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her appearance, as of course she would come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine young man, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again - she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery, or help listening, and answering with more animation than she had intended.
Fanny did not share her aunt's composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the three acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene between them which interested her most particularly, and which she was longing and dreading to see how they would perform.
Fanny estranged from him, silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of things; a state which he must break through, and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through.
Fanny explained.
Fanny felt for him most acutely.
Fanny felt obliged to speak.
Fanny felt that she must; and though she had not waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea, and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again, perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with constant delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her, with superior tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself, and glad to like whatever was liked by him, she was more sincerely impatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before; and on this being evident, she was so kindly asked to call again, to take them in her walk whenever she could, to come and hear more of the harp, that she felt it necessary to be done, if no objection arose at home.
Fanny felt that there must be a struggle in Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the effort so successfully made.
Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils of civility, would have been again most happy, could she have kept her eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford.
Fanny found herself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused of pride or indifference, or some other littleness; and having with modest reluctance given her consent, proceeded to make the selection.
Fanny found that it was not to be, and in the modesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable in expecting it.
Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the evening; but Henry's attentions had very little to do with it.
Fanny had been everywhere awake to the difference of the country since February; but when they entered the Park her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort.
Fanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she awoke the next morning; but she remembered the purport of her note, and was not less sanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before.
Fanny had hoped, in the course of his yesterday's visit, to hear the day named; but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere long.
Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but a message to say she hoped that her god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt her book.
Fanny had never heard the harp at all, and wished for it very much.
Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyed being avowedly useful as her aunt's companion when they called away the rest of the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally became everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party.
Fanny had not a word to say against its becomingness, and, excepting what remained of her scruples, was exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos.
Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.
Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton.
Fanny he must give up.
Fanny in those early days had preferred her to Susan; and when the news of her death had at last reached Mansfield, had for a short time been quite afflicted.
Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout; who has been consistent.
Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired.
Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the difference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction.
Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think of, or for anybody to wish that really knows us both.
Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness which, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering how it would end.
Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and took her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart, and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot had yet witnessed.
Fanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising.
Fanny pitied her.
Fanny said she was rested, and would have moved too, but this was not suffered.
Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there was no outward fellowship between them.
Fanny saw that she was approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still better.
Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed.
Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before.
Fanny shook her head.
Fanny shrunk back to her seat, with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits; and he talked on only to his son, and only of the Thrush, though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject, more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny, and her long absence and long journey.
Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris's threats of catching cold.
Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal; and her spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her.
Fanny spoke her feelings.
Fanny still resisted, and from her heart.
Fanny stood aghast.
Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think differently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could do, and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say that Julia was Mr. Crawford's choice, she knew not always what to think.
Fanny suspected what was going on.
Fanny thanked him again, but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much, or even to be certain of what she ought to say.
